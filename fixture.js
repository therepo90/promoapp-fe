            "title": "I Tried 4 Paid Services for Stock Selection: Here are The Results for 2021 and 2022",
            "text": "**ZACKS**\n\n**TLDR**\n\n* They make a ton of recommendations. Many products underperform the market\n* Their annual Top 10 list did great in 2021 but not 2022, but you pay for it at $3600 per year. You can get a base subscription for $249/yr for just the stock screeners which is reasonable, though many are baked into Fidelity’s platform for free.\n* Their stock screeners are great for finding stocks, especially the VGM and Zacks Rank #1 screener. But to do it right, you need to spend 5hrs a week on it seeing what’s new.\n\nZacks offers a couple dozen different lines of stock picking services plus a few dozen different stock screens. It’s quite overwhelming actually, but also a bit addictive to pour through them to find some good stocks. I found most of their services don’t outperform the market or have so many stocks in them it would be a full-time job to buy and manage them.\n\nFor most of the screeners, the time it takes to vet them and look at each of the 50 plus stocks in each is too much of a time commitment, but looking at the first few in the list gives some ideas of what is working.I started just looking at the recent additions to see if there were secular trends and that helped.\n\nI tried out some of their healthcare picks with mild success: I was going to share the names but the bots on here blocked them because they are under 300M market cap. One was bought out for 40% over purchase price. One went up 6X. Two fizzled down -70%. If you want the names DM me.  \n\n\nI did OK using the value, growth, and momentum stock screener but I really had to spend a lot of time separating out the good ones and figuring out what was recently added, which they don’t tell you. If you get them too late, the move has already occurred and you will likely see the stock correct quickly.\n\nA few gems I traded from their list around March of 2021 included SEM (health clinics), DAC (container shipping), BERY (financial), and MT (steel). My target was +100% for each and I made that within a year of buying for each. I bought options. HOLX was an exception. I lost -15% on that pick, though it was mostly due to the fact it soared high from COVID revenues and then sold off quickly as the vaccines rolled out. It’s since back to slightly above the purchase price.\n\n**Zacks Top 10 Stocks of 2021 -** their premium offering and associated returns. I did not buy all of these - only SPSC and PWR. But I did track them all in a watchlist.\n\n* **Percent Winner Rate: 90%**\n* **Avg return: 48%**\n* **SPY Return: 30%**\n\nAIMC (transmissions) 2021   \nReturn: -6%   \nReturn To date: - 23%\n\nSPSC (supply chain mgmt solutions)   \n2021 Return: +31%   \nReturn to Date: +15%\n\nAPTV (vehicle parts)   \n2021 Return: +28%   \nReturn to Date: -15%\n\nPWR (energy generation consulting services)   \n2021 Return: +64%   \nReturn to Date: +107%\n\nIAA (online vehicle sales)   \n2021 Return: +46%   \nReturn to Date: -41%\n\nWSC (storage units)   \n2021 Return: +72%   \nReturn to Date: +84%\n\nMacy’s (clothing retailer)   \n2021 Return: +144%   \nReturn to Date: +76%\n\nGDDY (domain registration)   \n2021 Return: +3%   \nReturn to Date: 0%\n\nZBRA (tech, sensors)   \n2021 Return: +54%   \nReturn to Date: -7%\n\nULTA (beauty stores)   \n2021 Return: +46%   \nReturn to Date: +38%\n\n**For 2022’s top 10 stocks,** the advice has not been quite so good, but the year isn’t over yet. I didn’t buy any this year because I was short on the market, but I have been tracking the performance to see if they can match what they did last year. So far, not so good.\n\n* **Percent Up Since Rec: 20%**\n* **Avg Return of Rec: -8.8%**\n* **SPY Return: -10.3% as of time I drafted**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2. LEVELFIELDS**\n\n**TLDR**:\n\n* Event-driven alerts work and I like that the success rate is visible on the website\n* There are a lot of alerts you can subscribe to, so it’s best to choose one of their lower volume, higher performing strategies to avoid opportunity overload\n* It’s good at finding high shorter term returns with high success rates\n* For the biggest companies (AAPL, TSLA, etc), my news alerts arrived faster. For those under 100B market cap, it's very helpful.\n* Price is 228/yr but their emails of a big update seem to be hinting a hike is coming soon\n\n**Winning Percent: 79%**\n\n**Avg Return/Trade: 23%**\n\nI’ve been using an event-driven research system called LevelFields for about a year now. It was a little rough around the edges in the early days but has gotten much better over time. It’s good at identifying news events early that drive stock prices up and down, often from direct announcements from companies. It shows stock patterns following events, which is cool, especially for the negative events so you can see how far the stock will probably fall. \n\nThey effectively filter the noise out of the news and just focus on a couple dozen event types that really shake stock prices: hedge fund investor moves, layoffs, shorts, FDA approvals, leadership changes, Amazon new product launches, and a couple dozen other types. Unlike the technical pattern alert systems out there I’ve seen, it focuses on real news, which I like, as I feel pattern trading is often a lot like staring at clouds and making shapes out of them in your mind.\n\nFor the big companies everyone watches, they don’t beat news alerts. But for the bulk of the companies you’ve never heard of or have forgotten about, it flags a lot of opportunities and companies on the rise.\n\nMost of the time I trade with the information. Sometimes I use it to find stocks for longer term plays. Like Zacks, they put out a lot of opportunities so any analysis here is going to be biased by what I’m choosing to act on. But they publish the success rate and show all past alerts so the past performance is embedded in the platform under each strategy, which is nice.\n\nThe winning rates for their strategies range from a high of 90% to a low of 50%, with most in the 70% range. You can alter the outcomes by adjusting the filters for the types of stocks. I don’t like to buy commodities and microcaps generally, as the prices fluctuate too much on factors beyond the company’s control, so I filter those out.\n\nLately, I’ve been trading on their layoffs scenario, which tracks companies firing people. If you filter for just expensive stocks that are firing people to grow earnings, you can get to 80% accuracy in price prediction. I’ve noticed some events cause the share prices to pop right away, so I often wait for the first selloff before entering the trade.\n\n**Here are the alerts I opted to act on and how they turned out**. I’m noting hold times since it’s not a buy and hold forever system though I supposed you could for some stocks.\n\n10.21.21 - Qualcomm. Return: stock rose +50% in 1 month. Traded options for +300% gain.  \n11.11.21 - Northern Gas (NOG). Return: +45%. I held for 5 months.  \n12.9.21 - CVS. return: +60% in 1 month (options)  \n11.18.21 - BLDR. Return: +67% in 4 days (options)  \n12.04.21 Signature Bank SBNY. Return: +16% in 1 month. I then traded a couple more times on it as it was doing well until the Crypto crash. It holds a lot of staked Bitcoin.\n\n12.6.21 Silicon Motion (SIMO). +25% in 2 months. Still like this semi and will buy back. They do memory chips and had been killing it. It was hard to find a cheap semi at one point but this one always traded at a reasonable p/e.\n\n12.9.21 Labcorp (LH): +8% in 1 month but I held it too long and exited down -10% due to covid rates dwindling and testing volumes decreasing\n\n12.15.21 - Broadcom (AVGO). Return: 0% Sold off when war started.   \n2.3.22 - Quest (DGX). Return: +50% in 1 month via option trade  \n2.15.22 - Upstart (UPST): Return: +30% on options in 1 week. I had owned this stock already and was trading it off and on for about a year..\n\n2.17.22 Blocked by mod bots from showing: +50% in 2 days   \n2.24.22 - ALSN (Allison Transmission ). Return: +8% in 1 month  \n3.11.22 - Applied Materials (AMAT). Return: +4% in a week.  \n3.17.22 - Lockheed Martin (LMT): Return: +70% in 3 weeks (option trade on news Germany was buying planes)\n\n3.17.22 - CMC Steel. Return: +10% in 1 month\n\n3.31.22 - LGVN. Return: +20% in 1 day.   \n5.9.22 - TWTR. Return +100% on puts in 1 mo. This was the “Elon will back out” trade a big hedge fund was betting on, so I joined them. A short would’ve worked too.\n\n5.24.22 - Digital Ocean (DOCN): Returns TBD. Up 8% on equity but I’m selling covered calls for an extra 20% annually. I really like this company. It’s like a mini AWS that is more cost effective for small businesses.\n\n6.15.22 - Space company. +50% in two days\n\n6.24.22 - Digital Turbine (APPS). +31% in 2 months. I think this was mostly luck given the timing of the bear market rally.\n\n6.28.22 - Alibaba (BABA). -30% on options in 3 weeks. Can’t seem to get a break on BABA.\n\n7.14.22 - Pinterest (PINS). +30% on hedge fund moves\n\n7.27.22 - Mining company. return: -10% on option puts. Still puzzled why the stock is up.\n\n7.28.22  +4% and holding. They are one of the only medicines for monkeypox.   \n8.12.22 - Peloton (PTON). +10% in a day on its layoff news\n\n8.15.22  -3%. It makes solar cells in China and is growing revenues by triple digits. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3. THE FOOL**\n\nI resisted trying out the Fool for years because they wrote so many articles and ads touting their stock picks that I assumed they had to be full of it. But, when I had enough money in the account, I decided to try it out and see if they maybe could save me some time finding stocks early or if they were the cause of certain pump and dumps I was watching.\n\n**TLDR**:\n\n* They pick good, overvalued growth stocks but they don’t try to time the market at all because they want 5 year hold times, which can lead to big drawdowns while you wait\n* I would’ve lost a fortune had I taken much of their advice. However, if you have a decade long time horizon and can stomach 75% pullbacks, the stocks they recommend will probably come out ahead\n* They repurpose recommendations from different subscription tiers, often using lower tier recs to increase the returns of higher level subscriptions\n* They make a lot of recommendations. It’s time consuming to keep up.\n* Big range of prices from $100/yr to $5,000/yr and they upsell a lot\n\nThey had a lot of subscription options to choose from that range from a hundred bucks or so a year to $5K per year. I signed up for a few of them, including their stock advisor, IPO one, and cloud innovators and small caps service. I should note that the lists they provide overlap enormously, so they clearly repurpose their recommendations and charge you more to get the same recs again and again.\n\nFor the cloud services recommendations, I found they generally picked out solid growth companies (DOCN, DOCU, ESTC,etc) but too late, after the stocks were already richly valued. So I traded them instead of buying them. Below are the email recommendations they sent out I saved.\n\n**12/17/21 Buy Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**\n\nIntel (INTC): -29%\n\nJFrog (FROG): -17%\n\nProcore (PCOR): -18%\n\n**12/14/21 Recommendations W/Subsequent Performance Since Then**\n\nSell Cloudflare (NET).

Return since: -35%\n\nBuy Twilio (TWLO). Return since:-66%\n\nBuy Zoom (ZM). Return since: -40%\n\n**I Tracked Every investment from their Small Caps Playbook List from January 2021. Here are their returns since then.**\n\n* **Percent Winners: 33%**\n* **Avg return per rec: -25%**\n\n1. Redacted by mods -88%\n2. Redacted by mods: +7%\n3. Camping World (CWH): +20%\n4.

Blocked by mods: 0%\n\nI kept emails of other recommendations, though I admit this list is not complete since they only sent emails containing the rec half the time. The rest of the time they send you to their website to watch a 30-minute webinar of their picks in the middle of the work day, which was strange to me and defeated my purpose of saving time digging through stock screeners. I tracked from the next day’s opening price.\n\n**StockAdvisor**\n\n2.3.22 Buy ABNB. Return Since: -17%\n\n1.6.22 Buy Confluent CFLT: Return since: -59%\n\n12.20.21 Sell Healthequity.

INVESTORS PLACE**\n\n**TLDR:**\n\n* Mostly recommend long-term, long shot stocks\n* Best recommendations are free. Most paid recommendations are mediocre at best\n* News is wrong sometimes\n* They are good at spotting long-term trends in where the new money is flowing to, e.g. thematic investing (online gambling, EVs, rare minerals, etc). I derived value from seeing companies linked to these trends I may not have heard of otherwise.\n\nThey make an obscene amount of recommendations across their blog and have many subsidiary newsletter services and promotional picks, so my tracking here is admittedly biased, as I only tracked what I ended up buying. Like Fool, they have a very long investing horizon and may end up being right…years from now. They make recommendations based on thematic trends, e.g. EVs, cybersecurity, etc. However, they also push recommendations based on events or news.\n\nI signed up for Matt McCall’s Investment Opportunities and followed their website recommendations. The newsletter divided up stock recommendations along long-term thematic investing trends like AI, 5G, EVs, online gambling, precious metals, crypto, data analytics, etc).\n\nTheir basic principal is long-term investing along big emerging trends. There were about 50 stocks or so in the portfolio at any given time, but since they do long-term investing, many had been in there for years and they offered no advice on how to enter a trade they had entered 4 years ago. So I never did.\n\nHere are the ones they recommended as buys that I actually bought:\n\n**Pct of Recommendations Up: 27%**\n\n**AVG Return**: Not able to calculate this since I didn’t take advice to hold long term for most\n\nEV Maker. Return: -100%\n\nI purchased some call options in this EV company (name blocked by mods) because they made an announcement the company was a shoe-in to get an $8B EV supplier contract with the U.S. Postal Service. They claimed there were no other competitors that made EVs and therefore this would be a game changer for the company. I didn’t do my own due diligence, stupidly. A few weeks later, the award went to Oshkash, a defense contractor most known for making military vehicles. Oshkash[ partnered](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a36826291/ford-supplier-usps-postal-truck/) with Ford on the contract to make the EVs. I lost 100% of my call options on this poorly sourced news piece.  \n\n\n7.15.21. Buy SWBI. Smith and Wesson: -40% since then. I sold it when there was a pop for breakeven returns after a shooting, which triggered an increase in price, sadly.\n\n1.4.21 Buy Chinese Pharma. Return: -48%\n\nThe return here has not been good as of late but it was up and I’m holding anyway as this company is the gatekeeper for a lot of large Pharmaceutical companies (Novartis, AstraZeneca, Amgen) to get into the Chinese market. In my view, it was a good recommendation and was largely up until recently.\n\n1.21.21. BUY (Block by mod bots): Return: +100% or 0% Correctly predicted the stock would double. It did, then gave up 100% of its gains. Glad I sold it when it doubled.\n\n1.22.21 Buy ad company (blocked by mods). Return: -76%. My stop loss triggered at -12%.\n\n2.1.21 Blocked by mod bots (rare earth minerals company). Return: +32% This was a good pick. I actually bought on the rec and made about 50% from trading options and selling covered calls. I would not have known about this stock without them. I plan to buy it back at 25. They are one of the few providers of the rare earth minerals in every electronic outside of China.\n\n2.4.21 Buy ACAD - Acadia Pharmaceuticals. Return: -71%. Their report cited 30% revenue growth and a robust pipeline of drugs. Revenue is around 17% growth now. At one point it had doubled in value. I’m still holding. My lesson learned: trade biotechs, don’t hold them.\n\n2.5.21 Buy REDACTED BY MODS. Return: -60%\n\nStraight downhill since the recommendation. Touted as a cutting edge AI/Machine learning data analytics company I bought 100 shares. Revenues are up 50% y/y but I sold it in February 2022 for a -20% loss.\n\n2.10.21 Buy rare earth minerals company. Return: +69%\n\nAnother good pick in a sector I knew nothing about prior to their recommendation. I have since sold it but was up +60% when I closed out. I will buy it again at some point when commodity prices have cooled.\n\nFeb 2021 Buy ILMN (Illumina - genetics company). Return since: -49% They pushed this stock hard and it tanked after each[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/ilmn-stock-will-be-unstoppable-once-the-grail-acquisition-gets-approved/), which made me believe it was a pump and dump job. I traded options on this one and cut losses -28%.\n\n2.19.21. Buy (blocked by mod bots) Return: -94% Thankfully stop lossed this one at -7%.\n\nFeb 26 2021 Buy FTCH (Farfetch 2nd hand clothing): Return: -85% I traded options on this one, using their[ recommendation](https://investorplace.com/hypergrowthinvesting/2021/02/farfetch-stock-buy-the-dip-in-ftch/) as the pump I dumped and made 20%.\n\n2.5.21. Buy (Blocked by mod bots). Return: -72%. Still holding. They offer sports gambling online and were growing revenues 75% y/ but it’s slowed to 16% growth.\n\n2.10.21 Buy online gambling co (blocked by mods). Return: -15%. Bought this one as the online gambling is doing well. We shall see.\n\n12.17.21 Buy NIO. Return since: -55%. I traded a few options on it but generally think EVs are overvalued and risky given the huge capital expenditures and exposure to macroeconomic issues. I ended up a few percent as I sold after an initial bump.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNote: Wrote this a week ago and much of the recs I couldn't put in because of the mods banning discussion of them",

            "title": "BlackBerry: How the Patent Sale could transform BB",
            "text": "On March 30, BlackBerry has reported Q4 and FY21 results/call AH. At first the market didn't like it and on the next trading day the stock lost 10% (panic mode, loss porn and so on). However within the next 2 trading days BB has regained all its $ in a quick reversal. I'm here to tell you why.\n\nThis is a followup to [my OP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/mhi3ev/blackberry_earningscall_were_actually_bullish/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) \n\n^(Quick note to the Mods: I believe my OP is about to bring new original content to the discussion and hopefully will be eligible to live its life as a post.)\n\n**Portfolio Patent Sale (big $$$)**\n\nQuick refresh: the stock fell because the revenue came below expectations but straightaway the company said it happened because they are currently negotiating the sale of a portion of their patents specifically related to ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** Consequently they had to voluntarily limit the monetisation of these patents during Q4.\n\nThe points I would like to investigate are: for how much $$ this sale could go, how likely this sale is to happen, who could be the buyer and when could it be completed?\n\n***First the money.*** CEO Chen during the call: *we will report a one-time gain of a reasonably big number, followed by a tail of up to seven years.* He also confirmed the yearly revenues for Licensing are around $250m. And that BB owns 38,000 patents. I will simply use these numbers with a DCF to estimate what that \"big number\" could be. Before I proceed I would like to emphasise that CEO also said: *we believe that the completion of the transaction will be beneficial to our shareholders* (if it happens).\n\nAssuming a 10% discount rate and 7 years of revenue life, we have $250m current year, $227m next year, $207m (...) to $141m for the final year. For a total of **$1,339bn.** That's quite a pleasing big number but let's be careful nonetheless: we don't know the size of the portfolio being negotiated and the payment is expected to be initially a lump sum  + 7years of tail royalties. So they could tweak it a bit.\n\nWith a 15% discount rate we get **$1,196bn** and at 20% **$1,081bn.** Another way to look at it: if we consider that they would sell only 75% of that side business and we discount it at 10% we still get a number north of a billion $ (consistent with CEO comment: *it's a major portion of our portfolio*). So money wise should the sale indeed happen we are looking at an one time cash flow of $1bn to $1.3bn. Not too shabby for a $5bn market cap company with already $800m cash in its hands (yes they could have momentarily circa 40% cash to mkt cap ratio).\n\n***Is this really happening?*** There is a high probability it would maybe 80% but it's not cleared yet. To get to this conclusion I listened twice to the conf call to try to decipher the clues. Whenever CEO was talking about the amount he sounded as if that part was near completion (*will be a big number* and *the majority of the deal will come in one-time early, but there is a tail that goes on*). Although he also stated that *the company has not yet reached a definitive binding agreement and negotiations are ongoing.*\n\nThe main hurdle might be the regulatory review of the transaction as the big boss mentioned that in the most conservative scenario: *we assume that negotiation and regulatory review continue for the first half* (of FY). A sentence that directly leads me to believe that the buyer could be a major company.\n\n***Big money buyer:*** if there is a lengthy regulatory review it might be because the potential purchaser could be in a position to infringe antitrust laws (NB: antitrust laws were created by Congress to preserve competition among businesses and prevent any one business from dominating a single industry and building a monopoly). \n\nSpeculations are ongoing that the buyer could be Facebook. It's honestly hard to say but that's the name with the higher odds at the moment. Just to recall BB sued FB in 2018, claiming the social media giant was using BlackBerry inventions in its messaging applications. Then they settled the dispute in January 2021 over patent royalties for terms that weren’t disclosed. You see the analogy here. By the way during the conf call this settlement was never mentioned and we still didn't see the financial repercussions in BB accountancy.\n\nThat said it could very well be someone else from North America, which leads us to the when.\n\n***The timing of the sale*** is honestly hard to guess but again let's refer to the CEO comment that in their most conservative scenario the discussions could continue during H1. Subjectively I tend to believe that it would happen sooner rather than later because 1. they are losing money by restricting their Licensing every day that goes by and 2. it was *the* major statement in their whole conference call. You can arguably think that you would release this kind of communication when negotiations are very advanced. If I had to bet I would say it's a matter of a few weeks obviously subject to the regulatory approval.\n\n**The Transformation**\n\nBy now unless if you've been living on Mars because that game rocket took you too far, you must know that BlackBerry is no longer an handset company. They excel at cybersecurity, they are deeply involved in the automotive industry including EV thanks to QNX and they are coming big hand in hand with Amazon to bring IVY to the world (October early release and Feb22 full product).\n\nIf and when they sell that side portfolio to a potentially big name you can expect all financial and traditional media to report the transaction and to emphasise the renewal, the rebirth of BlackBerry as an Internet of Things, Cybersecurity high-margins long-duration Tech company.\n\nIn terms of communication they have just started and they are about to splash the cash to continue on. John Chen is quite excited about it: *you will see us being more aggressive, in fact we ran an ad today Intelligent Security everywhere, an ad today. I just saw it on the New York Times and so we're just going to step-up in both people and spending and resources to go after the market and it is a huge, as you know very well, it is a huge market and no clear winner at this point.*\n\nHe later added that: *we have a reasonably large number of hires mostly in sales and marketing.*\n\n***IVY is not priced in at all:*** there is no other way to say it. At the current BB valuation investors are totally ignoring the potential of IVY, probably because they don't understand it. Let me go straight to the point.\n\n*BB and AWS said the new intelligent vehicle data platform, called IVY, will compress the time to build, deploy and monetize in-vehicle applications and connected services across multiple brands and models, making it easier for automakers to collaborate with a wider pool of developers to accelerate development of apps and services.*\n\nThe goal is to establish IVY as a standard platform across the auto industry, as Apple and Google have done in mobile phones through their iOS and Android platforms. This way IVY could be the equivalent of the App Store but for all mobility platforms whether EV, autonomous driving EV, air drones, rockets (SpaceX already using QNX) etc. The end uses are potentially limitless and most of the current discussed applications are under NDAs. Once they start to pop out, the picture will get clearer and clearer.\n\nSimilarly to what Apple did back in the days, BB has started an IVY Fund with $50m in it + $100K AWS credit for new startups willing to develop a product on IVY. Let's also not forget that the deal was approved by Andy Jassy in December who later got upgraded from AWS big boss to Amazon CEO. We can reasonably imagine that he values IVY as a potential disruptor and Chen sees it as a *significant growth opportunity.* Initially thought to hit the market in 2023, the early release will be available as soon as October 2021 (again the market is sleeping on this advancement).\n\nOne quick word on the cybersecurity part of the business: BB and CRWD have roughly the same yearly revenue (I will leave it to the experts to discuss how comparable they are). One company has $5bn market cap and the other $44bn.\n\n**The Bear Case**\n\nIf the sale doesn't happen at all that's gonna look bad and hurt financially. Still according to the call, *full year licensing revenue will be in the region of $100 million* (if the sale fail) vs an usual $250m per year. As mentioned throughout that's because they are limiting the Licensing revenue while negotiating. Cybersecurity growth, QNX and IVY will still remain in play but more as mid and long term catalysts. They would still push for sales and marketing but the blue sky scenario obviously implies the receipt of a billion $ in cash in exchange of their accessory patents.\n\n*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*\n\n*Disclosure: long BB shares and June 20C and 15C (in that order).*\n\n**TLDR:** BB is selling their old business patents probably for more than $1bn to a big player in order to focus on their new business model - cybersecurity, IoT, QNX, IVY - and come back like what's up.",

            "text": "More info over on r/retard_bot\n\nNotice the title is now $5K to $106K, not $1M. It takes \\~25% weekly gainz to hit $1M from $5K in 6 months. Last week the market shit itself and Retard Bot only printed 13% By Tuesday when it gave fail-stop orders to sell, so 13% avg so far = $106K.\n\n***Edit: For new people,*** *since the original posts got removed after hitting the front page of WSB, Retard Bot is retarded code I wrote in JavaScript to fry tendies with. But instead of the 100% loss I expected, I got 100% gainz 3 consecutive weeks paper trading / testing it. Now I'm putting my IRL money on the line with it, more info below.*\n\nOriginal posts:\n\n* [Climbing from $5K to $1Mil in 24 weeks with a retard bot \\[ week 1 \\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/)\n* [$5K to 1 Mil Retard Bot \\[ Week 1 Results \\] \\[+13%\\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/)\n\nThis post is long but the important shit is at the top.\n\n[Ultra wide monitor compatible full resolution desktop background for all 🌈🐻s](https://preview.redd.it/i4ixunof5iz41.png?width=2560&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=13310910157edb640306bb43f60a6c6e474c2e8b)\n\nLast week 2 things happened affecting retard bot.\n\n1. I was banned from WSB by the 🏳️‍🌈 mods because they thought retard bot was fake.\n2. Jpow made a speech to expect a sideways market until he orders new inkjet cartridges.\n\nOn Tuesday I posted Retard Bot’s monday positions that had made 13% already when #2 happened, I had only trained it to handle a bull market so when the trailing failstops alerted me to sell I pulled out of the positions with the 13% gainz (lol no i didn't, I held like a retard and had to buy SPY puts to ride back up to 15% for the week). This made it to where my only gainz were before I posted the positions Tuesday, so thats why the mods thought it was fake.\n\nSo we reached an agreement that I would only post Retard Bot’s trades live from now on so you all can know this isn’t all 🏳️‍🌈 wsbgod style bullshit. Fair enough.\n\nI meme and shit about training retard bot with inversed DD because it’s what makes wsb fun, but it’s really a complex program I spent 3 weeks of 12 hour days developing because I’m addicted to seeing green in my RH account. Autistic shit: It is actually JavaScript, powered by Node.js, using clustering to go multi-threaded and leverage every core of every AWS cloud server I load it onto, reporting back to a command and control server that combines progress learned from ML so I can dump money into more and more computational power to speed up the machine learning with some of the tendies I make from it and make Retard Bot less and less retarded every day. **Retard translation:** Runs on Internet Explorer.\n\n**So what happens next?**\n\nRight now retard bot only knows calls. Unless today magically turns into a bull market: I need a week to give Retard Bot the tools to profit in a crab or bear market. I have 4 twelve packs of Mountain Dew, GUH pulled up on YouTube with some lube at the ready, and most of the week off of work. Starting next monday, RB will know how to use not just calls, but puts for severely downward projections, spreads for high volatility upward and downward projections, and iron condors for high volatility sideways projections. And it’ll post its trades in real-time throughout the week as comments to the monday post I make.\n\nI’m gonna use the bear market data from 2000 and ‘08 to make sure the retard bot is 🏳️‍🌈 enough to be up for the challenge and train it if it’s not.\n\n**What else?**\n\nIntroduction of Starter Mode:\n\nOn the [Friday week 1 results post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a pretty good comment got posted that most of us broke bitchez can relate to:\n\n[Being below $25,000 is a pain in the sack because you can't flip day-trades like a madcunt, lest you get flagged.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/fqsq250/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI also have this problem. And now that the market's on hard mode since Jpow announced his printer is running out of ink, I can't just sell Retard Bot's positions if the market crashes and the broker flags my day trades.\n\nSo I spent the weekend coding a Starter Mode for Retard Bot, designed for going from $5K to $25K. It cherry picks the very best 3 positions it can find in the final 3 hours of each weekday so if the market crashes, it shouldn't drop much before close so RB can sell the next day or same day if it's a really bad drop and use the 3 day trades quota for the week.\n\nThat's all you 🌈🐻s need to know. Go make infinite tendies on deep otm spy puts. Peace bitchez. Until next week.\n\nBut for those of you autistic fucks that need more info than that well here it shitfucking is. I got asked so many questions and PMs when the last two posts for week 1 hit WSB front page, I wanna address them all so you tardfucks can stop blowing up my in-box.\n\n**Project Map**\n\n1. Pass real time analysis of a gecko's eating patterns into retard bot's machine learning system to project current upcoming market sentiment\n2. Add support for spreads. A co-worker kept telling me they're better, and make time work for you, theta, IV, something something, which was boring so I didnt care. But then I read [a DD confirming this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gk3bq3/a_basic_introduction_to_vertical_spreads_stop/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) which obviously makes it fact.\n3. If the retard keeps shitting out gainz, I build a free website and app so you autists can watch its shit choices in real time. Any excuse to not watch your own accounts shit out more red than that wedding in GoT.\n\n**FAQ**\n\n&gt;**Q:** [If you see results, would you make this available to us all? I just checked and retardbot.com is available.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqd58aa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***A:*** Yes, if the retard keeps shitting out tendies, I will publish a free app and website for wsb that shares retard bot's live trades.

Its retarded so I only gave it a list of the top 100 stocks so it wouldnt lose all my money. It also only touches high volume stuff, lower volume decreases its likelihood of buying an option. And now it’s learning spreads, which are black magic fuckery far too complicated for us austic SPY put warriors to understand. But according to some DD I read somewhere, people mirroring your spread positions doesn’t inflate the value like it can with calls (Hence the 🏳️‍🌈 ULTA guy’s gainz). Nothing Retard Bot touches will be susceptible to market manipulation even if all million of us broke 🌈🐻s join our combined wellfare checks on the same position. Furthermore:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Q:** [Should I mirror Retard Bot's plays?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqdbuh8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***A:*** Fuck no. This is not financial advice. Suggesting that could be considered market manipulation, which we all know is against SEC rules and more importantly WSB rules. Retard Bot is for entertainment purposes only. But in case any of you shitfucks are gonna try and mirror plays from some retarded fuckin JavaScript bot trained by WSB DD, powered by Internet Explorer, let's look at the next Q&amp;A:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;**Q:** [I bought your shitty crm call. What a flop](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gkfmp2/5k_to_1_mil_retard_bot_week_1_results_13/fqrhppv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;***A:*** I made +65% and +91% on those shitty CRM calls monday by 3:10 EST. Bought them between 9AM-11AM.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[The TECH call started at 0.01 that's why it's fucky](https://preview.redd.it/5wqnzh5s5iz41.png?width=250&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=df35e87b1612d7a3ecb4201df0fac5205e462b58)\n\n&gt;In the first three weeks retard bot selected positions that unanimously held 100%+ weekly profit without selling, but *that's not what it's designed to do.* It's called Retard Bot not genius bot, it follows momentum and quality, but you bought on Tuesday when I posted and by that time the market was in free fall. **You bought calls during a market crash dipshit.**\n\n**!!!! EMERGENCY DD FOR TOP WSB RETARDS !!!!**\n\nBefore you fuckshits go mirror Retard Bot's plays anyway like retard humans, some shit to consider:\n\n* Notice retard bot buys a bunch of diverse positions for the budget set so far ($5K)? Thats because if it's wrong about one, the rest are still likely to print. Mirroring just one position of 5-10 is a far worse risk vs reward scenario than buying all of them.\n* The market is unpredictable, and a bot can perform lightning fast fail-safe sales when things go bad, with zero emotion. Our dumb asses tend to scream “diamond hands” while we watch our savings swirl their final lap around the toilet bowl. GUH\n* There's not enough data yet, since its inception Retard Bot has been tested (until this upcoming monday) in a mostly bull market, there's no way 100% weekly gains last forever and there will eventually be a loss week.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Q: How does it work? Is there a GitHub repo? Can you share the code? I'm a developer and I'd like to work with you on this.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;A: Of course you would. If things stay even a tiny fraction of their current retard level, that makes it worth a shitfuckton of tendies. I'm not giving out the code. I'm not sharing my whole algorithm. But I have shared [some details on how it works](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gi7tp7/climbing_from_5k_to_1mil_in_24_weeks_with_a/fqd8sos/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) without giving away the secrets. **ELI5:** It looks for the best stocks based on volatility performance and uses that to conservatively form a momentum-based strike projection. **end ELI5.** For those still curious: Based on that, the current growth estimate of the option is calculated in relation to the intrensic value of the option at expiry if it follows the conservatively projected trend. A score is figured from those metrics in a machine learning based way. After a few more steps of scoring some secret sauce metrics are used to polish up those results. Neural networks are then added dynamically to find relationships between thousands of factors and the model's successful choices, sort of like post-processing. During this process millions of variations of the model exist competing for the best performance. Different models perform better in different market conditions and even in different industries. Top performing models are dynamically linked to different market conditions and even specific stocks. Based on those conditions, different models are given different portions of the cash pool to invest based on the correlation between their success and the market conditions. Once I add spreads and condors and other tools, different model categories will evolve and the best performers will be ranked market-condition dependent. I omitted enough key details that are pretty integral to the system to make sure Wallstreet big brains arent given what they need to come close to replicating what I built. I won't be making any more comments on the topic.\n\nIf retard bot stays performing above 3% weekly, I plan to feed it till it's 🏳️‍🌈 ass 🌈s out yacht money, and I'm inviting every one of you fucktards to party on it.",

He's also patiently answered all my questions, so thank you king.\n\nI've been following this since the beginning, and even made an account on Truth Social to see what the bulls are thinking. Honestly some of the shit they come out with over there make the regards on this sub seem like fucking Albert Einstein.\n\nI'll also preface this by saying I have a terrible trading record, mostly crippling losses, so obviously none of this is financial advice and you should ignore everything I say. If anything is incorrect drop a comment below and i'll fix it.\n\n# Overview\n\nYou probably already know what this is about, so I won't go into to much detail. Back in 2021, Trump started his own company, TMTG (Trump Media and Technology Group), which owns the social media network Truth Social. It wasn't actually Trump's idea, it was pitched to him, more on this later. The aim is to bring this to the public markets via a SPAC merger with DWAC (Digital World Acquisition Corp). Yesterday shareholders approved the merger, and it's set to complete this merge next week. DWAC has been trading publicly for a few years now, soon the ticker will change to DJT when the merger is finalised.\n\nBefore I get into the finer details, here's a quick TL;DR of the bull and bear points for those who will look at this post and say \"i'm not reading all that\"\n\n# Bullish\n\n* Trump is a hype machine.\n* Something something woke mind virus and free speech\n* Truth Social is a soapbox for Trump, and everyone listens to what he says.\n* The run-up to the election will generate a lot of hype.\n* If Trump wins the election, DJT could trade on hype for a long time\n* In theory, if he does win the election, TMTG could become significantly more relevant, leading to an improvement in its fundamentals.\n* If the above happens, it's possible TMTG could bring to market their other proposed ventures - a news network and competitor to the existing streaming services.\n\n# Bearish\n\n* The fundamentals are pure dogshit\n* If Trump loses the election, it's all over, TMTG will probably go bankrupt.\n* Trump could potentially sell shares around the time of the merger.\n* DJT will be propped up by just hype, not adequate shareholder equity, which is volatile and unstable.\n* The dilution could cause a significant drop in share price if there isn't enough hype to offset it.\n* Trump is a serial grifter who's failed at many businesses in the past and screwed over countless customers, investors, suppliers and more.\n* SPACs have had a terrible track record in recent years, espeically those with poor fundamantals.\n* SPACs are a cheap way to go to market, with the shareholders bearing the cost of this.\n* TMTG has no path to profitability in the forseable future. It has not provided any updated business plans, future growth estimates, guidance or updated revenue projections. The entire company feels like it's fake, it is not acting like a normal startup would.\n* The other proposed ventures (news network, streaming service) are extremely expensive to get going, we're talking hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars just to get off the ground. As i'll explain later, TMTG *could* have gained the cash to do this through the merger, but unwound it, making these ventures completely unfeasible with the cash DJT will get in this merger.\n* Trump is desperate, and backed into a corner. He owes so much money, not just on the recent court judgements, but across his real estate porfolio as well.\n\nRight lets get into the details.\n\n# Truth Social\n\nCurrently, Truth Social is the only revenue stream that TMTG has. I don't know if you've been on there at all but it's basically a hive-mind echo chamber of Trump worship.\n\nThere's basically 3 types of users:\n\n* MAGA cult\n* Bots shilling ED pills and fake gold coins.\n* A small number of anti-Trump trolls, posting on every truth Trump does.\n\nI am of the opinion that Truth Social is a completely flawed concept. The concept is that Trump is trying to make a social media network, or \"big tent\", that will be a town-square that is used by everyone - Republicans, Democrats, independents, everyone.\n\nIn reality, Truth Social is a social media network hashed together from open source code to spread one-sided propaganda of a presidential candidate. Right off the bat it's a one-sided Trumpfest, and does not make any effort to include anyone other than MAGA.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton made a social media network, do you think MAGA would join it? They absolutely wouldn't and this question just highlights their flawed thinking.\n\nYou can say what you want about the one-sided nature that the legacy social media networks like Twitter became, but they weren't set up by a political candidate solely to give them a soapbox.\n\nThere's also nearly no unique IP behind Truth Social. It's an open-source platform with no unique features. Other than (currently) the only way to hear Trump's thoughts as he takes a shit, it's worthless. It doesn't even live up to it's \"free speech\" claims, as they regularly ban people for arbitrary reasons.\n\n# Fundamentals\n\nUnsurprisingly, the fundamentals of this company are absolute dogshit. This company makes barely any revenue, and has losses in the tens of millions. I can't see how this is going to get any better after merger, and they'll have an $18m SEC fine to pay.\n\nFrom the balance sheet from the latest revision of the S4 in February:\n\nFor the 9 months ended September 30 2023, TMTG made about $3.2m, with an operating loss on that is about $10m.\n\nTMTG claimed that in it's current financial year it projects to make about $17m in revenue, although I can't see how this projection wold be accurate. There's not been any meaningful uptick in users on Truth Social, major advertisers still avoid advertising there, and the other alleged revenue streams that they proposed early on (like a news network and streaming competitor) haven't come to fruition.\n\n# There's barely any cash backing shares of DJT\n\nThe shareholder equity of DJT after the merger will be painfully low. After the merger completes, DJT will have access to the money in the trust. This money is essentially the money that DWAC sold the original DWAC shares for when it initially entered the market before it found an acquisition target (TMTG) - about 30m shares at $10/share - so the trust has approximately $300 million in it.\n\nAfter the merger, DJT will have to pay an $18m fine to the SEC as a result of the investigation which concluded last year.\n\nIgnore the current market value of DWAC shares for a moment. Let's look at how much cash is actually backing each share. Doing a rudimentary calculation (because we don't know exactly how much money DJT will actually get from the trust, or in-depth details of the current liabilities TMTG has): Lets say we take the full value of the $300m trust, minus the SEC fine, and the actual cash backing each share of DJT will be approximately $2.08 per share. This value could be even lower, as legal fees and other operational expenses (like DWAC expenses, and potentially costs of their lawsuits) need to be subtracted from the trust on merger before the cash is released to DJT.\n\nThis low cash backing for each share is very low, it's even very low for a SPAC. In the last four years, the average cash backing per share after merge of all SPACs was about $6.67.\n\nNormally, SPACs obtain PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity) investment during the merger process to offset low cash per share after merge. They specifically do this to ensure the SPAC can meet its operational obligations, and pay all the required costs to bring the merger to market.\n\nDWAC did have a $1.3b PIPE deal set up. This would have given the company an absolute shit ton of money, enough to fund operations for years, and fuel expansion and growth. It would have meant that each share of DJT would have been worth approximately $11.80 - pretty solid cash backing for a SPAC.\n\nHowever, they completely unwound this PIPE investment. My guess is because they didn't want the extreme dilution that the PIPE would have caused. The PIPE shares were not under lockup, and PIPE investors could have sold immediately on market open after the merger, destroying the share price. They were given a good deal on the shares (it was a percentage below current market value), so likely would have sold for an immediate profit. Remember this part because it works into my regarded theory later on. Spoiler alert: They weren't protecting the retail shareholders by doing this.\n\n# Ownership and dilution - what about the 1 billion shares?\n\nCurrently, DWAC is mostly owned by retail. These retail shareholders are somewhat unlike \"normal\" retail shareholders in that they are insanely dedicated. Many of the estimated 400,000 retail shareholders in this will not sell for any reason. Trump could literally dump shit in their faces and they'd probably take it and hold their shares. You could say that this retail holding is stronger than in the average company\n\nAfter the merger this will all change.\n\nCurrently the float of DWAC is about 30m shares.\n\nAfter the merger, the DJT float will swell to about 135m shares. The majority of these shares will be owned by Trump, currently under lockup for 6 months (more on this later).\n\nThere's been lots of talk about 1 billion shares being dumped into the float after merger. This has even been widely circulated in the press, but it's incorrect.\n\nDWAC have *authorised* 1 billion shares, it hasn't *issued* them. This means that in the future, DJT could potentially issue up to 1 billion more shares without having to conduct a shareholder vote or amend the company charter. It's like 1 billion reserve shares sat there if they need it.\n\nIt's actually a pretty common thing to do with IPOs and SPACs, many companies authorise shares to be issued later on to raise capital etc.\n\nIn any case, if they did issue more shares from this 1 billion amount, it wouldn't be until way after the merger.\n\nThere will, however, be significant dilution on merge. On business completion, up to 8,369,509 shares will be dumped into the float, given to holders of TMTG convertible notes. These shares will not be locked up like other insider shares, and can be sold immediately after merge. The holders of these notes will likely do this because they'll immediately realise a 400%+ gain. This is significant dilution, and could cause a huge drop in share price, unless insane Trump mania causes a hype rally to offset it. Much of the rest of the float is potentially (foreshadowing here) locked up, but this 8m share dump is significant.\n\n# Trump hype\n\nThe hype surrounding trump is real. We've seen it many times before with DWAC - the insane rally to $175/share was surreal. It's plummet after was equally unreal.\n\nThe hype has the potential to offset everything - shitty fundamentals, insane dilution and more. It's the reason DWAC has traded so far away from reality in terms of an accurate valuation.\n\nI'm sure you all saw this post about the hype, that led to you all pumping up the price of the OP's contracts by like 800% before he sold most of them:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these\\_calls\\_could\\_be\\_500\\_baggers\\_turn\\_1000\\_into/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bikpfj/these_calls_could_be_500_baggers_turn_1000_into/)\n\nThe first takeaway from the above DD is that the hype is fucking insane, and supersedes everything, can cause the share price to rocket to the moon regardless of anything else.\n\nI agree with this. It's possible that there will be a huge buying demand to offset the dilution on merge. DJT could rally to the fucking moon.\n\nThe other is the theory that Trump will shill DJT and all his MAGA cult will all rush to buy in.\n\nThis theory i'm not convinced on. Much of his cult have no idea how to trade shares, many of them are braindead and can barely read. And if you think that they'd buy shares anyway, think about this:\n\nTrump has literally been on-stage at rallies in front of tens of thousands of his most die-hard supporters, and directly shilled Truth Social to them and they *still* haven't rushed to join. And Truth Social is a zero-barrier, free to use social media network specifically set up for them.\n\nI personally don't think we'll see millions of MAGA pouring into the market to buy DJT. Any MAGA who already know how to trade will be holding shares of DWAC already.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Regarded Trump selling theory - now with updates!\n\nNow it's time for the juicy stuff - the regarded speculative theory on Trump selling shares.\n\nDisclaimer: This is a regarded theory that probably won't happen, obviously i'm jumping to conclusions not necessarily found in hard evidence. If it does happen, though, I expect to be awarded a flair from the mods.\n\nIt's widely understood that Trump has a lockup on his shares for six months after the merger.\n\nThere is, however, a clause that undermines this.\n\nIn the [latest revision of the S4](https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=90423&amp;ref=318071075&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=DWAC&amp;cdn=7df8a564ed5159633ce6abd5829662e5&amp;companyName=Digital+World+Acquisition+Corp.&amp;formType=S-4%2FA&amp;formDescription=%5BAmend%5D+Registration+of+securities%2C+business+combinations&amp;dateFiled=2024-02-14), filed in February, on page 42, it reads:\n\n&gt;Lock-Up. **Unless waived by Digital World prior to the Closing**, key stockholders of TMTG (including its management team) agreed to be subject to a six-month lockup in respect of their Digital World common stock, subject to certain customary exceptions, which would provide important stability to the leadership and governance of TMTG.\n\nThis means that, at any time before the merger closes, DWAC could waive Trump's lockup for some or all of his shares. Further to this, they could do it before it was disclosed publicly. Trump could even sell shares for several days before it would be publicly known by DJT issuing its first 8K approximately 4 days after the merger, or Trump filing a Form 4 to disclose the sale.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous comments, I theorise that Trump could potentially dump some or maybe even all of his shares, potentially even destroying the company and allowing him to walk away with billions. He could then just go back to X to continue to be able to reach an audience far bigger than on TS.\n\nRemember when Trump met with Elon earlier this month, and everyone thought it was to do with Elon donating to Trump's campaign? Wrong. I theorise that they were doing a mutually-beneficial deal:\n\nElon agrees to ensure Trump never gets banned from X under any circumstances, ensuring he always has a soapbox.\n\nTrump agrees to return to X, giving Elon a huge bump in viewers.\n\nTrump dumps a load of his shares, pays his legal bills, makes a shit ton of money, gets a much bigger audience on X compared to Truth Social. It's a win win for both of them.\n\n**Additionally, I theorise that DWAC unwound the PIPE deal not for retail shareholder benefit, but to avoid Trump's shares from dropping in value so he could sell them at a higher price after merge. DWAC never issued a reason publicly as to why they unwound the PIPE. Unwinding the PIPE is seriously detrimental to the core of the business itself. It means significantly less cash to fund operations for a company that makes yearly losses in the tens of millions with no path to profitability.**\n\nThe company will get under $300m of cash, rather than nearly $1.6bn it would have gotten with the PIPE deal + initial $300m share offering by DWAC. I'm yet to hear a reasonable explination as to why DWAC would unwind the PIPE.\n\nSomething else to consider: once DJT comes to market, DWAC is essentially liquidated. It ceases to be a company, the board is dispanded and no longer work for DWAC, it's shares are swallowed up by DJT. It is **DWAC** that could waive the lockup. If shareholders were furious - would they even be able to sue a company that no longer exists? Would they even be able to join together to file an expensive lawsuit against DWAC?\n\nThe counters to the above tin-foil hat theory are:\n\n\"But Trump wouldn't need to sell, he could just borrow against his shares\"\n\nI'm not convinced about this for several reasons. Firstly, what sane lender is going to lend up shares that are under lockup for 6 months. They wouldn't be able to force Trump to sell his shares to repay the debt for up to 6 months if he defaulted on the loan. Secondly, TMTG is basically worthless, with barely any shareholder equity as described above...his shares aren't worth anything and have barely any cash backing them. Lenders will want solid fundamentals before lending against shares, they aren't gonna lend him half a billion $ on shares that are propped up on hype. He recently went to more than 30 surety companies recently to try and get a loan to pay his bond, and all of them turned him down. None of them would accept real estate or non-liquid assets as collateral.\n\n[Reuters is also reporting](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/investors-greenlight-trumps-6-billion-social-media-deal-2024-03-22/) that he can't borrow against them due to previous terms he's agreed to:\n\n&gt;It is unclear how and when these cases will be resolved. Even if the  deal gets completed next week, Trump will not be allowed to sell any of  his shares in the combined company for six months **or borrow against them**, based on terms he previously agreed.\n\nHe likely wouldn't be able to borrow against his shares even if his restriction was lifted.\n\n\"The board wouldn't allow it\"\n\nGo look at who the board of DJT is made up of: Trump, his sons and some of his closest yes-men. He basically controls the board. The DWAC board is made up of Trump yes-men as well. The fucking SEC investigation was specifically about how Trump colluded with DWAC without disclosing it publicly.\n\n\"Why would Trump destroy his own company?\"\n\nBecause said company is basically worthless. It has a high share price now based on hype, but it's going to take A LOT of work to get it generating revenue and profit. When the hype dies down, the share price could plummet, reducing hes unrealised net worth. If he loses the election it's all over, and if he hasn't sold by that point he'd lose BILLIONS. Institutional investors won't be touching this, so there won't be a solid foundation of ownership.\n\nTrump looks out for himself, and he's backed into a corner. Dumping his entire holding of DJT would literally solve all of his monitary issues - court judgements, mortgage/lease payments on his properties, funding of his campaign and more.\n\n\"But he's screwing over his base\"\n\nObviously there's a risk here, in that dumping his shares on his cult could cause a significant backlash, and he needs every vote he can get going into an election. However current DWAC shareholders are a tiny percentage of his base. If he dumped his shares on them, the majority of his base probably wouldn't even know about it. I'm not even convinced they'd turn on him either, they are literally in a cult. Remember when he said this back in 2016: \"I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters, OK?\". Still rings true today.\n\nTrump is desperate. NY is about to start seizing his assets, potentially within days. I can't imagine him choosing TMTG over Trump Tower for example, especially when he could potentially liquidate his entire holding of TMTG for an immediate gain of several billion cash.\n\n# What's going to happen after merger?\n\nHonestly...who fucking knows. It could absolutely shit the bed due to dilution even if Trump doesn't sell shares.\n\nOr the hype of Trump could propel the share price into the stratosphere.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to add in the next step which will be the ticker changing from DWAC to DJT. The earliest this could happen is Monday. However an actual date hasn't been announced yet, so it could be Tuesday or Wednesday, or even later towards the end of the week.\n\nI could, and probably will be, wrong about all of this. Be sensible and don't trade this merger.\n\nHave fun regards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "text": "# If you find this interesting please follow my account for more DD.\n\n# I'm also working on an Excel file which will provide all fundamental data about a stock, more info about that on my account. TLDR at bottom!\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWith the change and progressing to extremer climates, global warming is coming our way. It has been shown world governments are incapable of properly taking action against this threat. Since it seems like global warming won’t be stopped, we will have to start adapting to the new extreme climates. One way of ensuring a comfortable living/working space in this grim future is by making use of HVAC (Heating Ventilation &amp; Air Conditioning). **And that’s what got me thinking**. My family has been hell bent on **NOT** getting air-conditioning. But with the summer temperatures ever more frequently reaching +40c with a humidity of +70%(Hup Holland Hup) it’s becoming unbearable. Sleepless nights, overheated pets, fainting, old people dying and just losing your will to live. These are all issues more people around the world are starting to face. Every place on earth is getting more extreme. Every place on earth is getting more need for Climate control. And every company is looking to profit of that! This is why my next play is in the HVAC industry. \n\n**Finding our compatible companies.** \n\nI only want to invest in the best companies. Living in The Netherlands I personally don’t know the best brands, luckily, I’ve got great internet. So, after spitting through some review sites these are the 5 public companies that came out best when looking for “Best HVAC/Air-conditioning companies/brands”. (Not ranked) \n\n1. Carrier (Day&amp;Night, Bryant, Toshiba &amp; 15 more)\n\n2. Trane (American Standard, Thermo King &amp; 7 more). \n\n3. Daikin (Goodman, Amana). \n\n4. Lennox (Service Experts, Allies Air Enterprises). \n\n5. Johnson Controls (Hitachi, York)\n\n**Understanding the HVAC market.**\n\nBefore we continue to further analyze the companies, we first need to understand the HVAC market.\n\nSome facts: \n\n1. The HVAC business has been valued at $91.30B in 2020 and is expected to reach $173B by 2024 and $367B by 2030. That’s a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of +/-15%. \n\n2. The most popular countries for Air Conditioning (AC) per household are: Japan 91%, USA 90%, Korea 86%, Saudi Arabia 53%, China 60%. \n\n3. Global stock of AC is expected to grow to 5.6B by 2050, up from 1.6B in 2018. (This is 1 AC sold every second for the next 30 years).\n\n4. Less than a third of the global households own an AC.\n\n5. 8% of the 2.8B people living in the hottest parts of the world own an AC (Brazil, Indonesia, India, African countries).\n\n6. AC demand is increasing every year going from 97,60M in 2012, up 111M in 2018.\n\nAs can been seen in the above statements the HVAC business is very well integrated in some large countries. But the most exciting prospects are those of the developing countries. In Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and India only 16%, 16%, 9%, 6% and 5% respectively of the households have AC. This is a MASSIVE market just waiting to be exploited.\n\n\\- The Indian AC market stood at $4,3B in 2017 and is expected to surpass 11B by 2023, that’s a CAGR of over 17%. This rising growth is led by rising infrastructure development, growing demand for housing and the constantly rising temperatures and consumers purchasing power.\n\n\\- The Middle Eastern and African market is expected to have an CAGR of 4,9% during 2019-2024.\n\n\\- The Indonesian market is currently experiencing a 2% CAGR in AC demand over 2012 till 2018.\n\n\\- The US is expected to have a CAGR of 3.1% from 2020 to 2030.\n\n\\- Europe is expected to have a CAGR of 6% from 2019 to 2025.\n\n\\- **The global HVAC market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 5.5% from 2018 till 2024**.\n\n**Market share.**\n\nThis was actually really really difficult to find free sources on and I can’t really make a clear picture out of it so here are the numbers:\n\n\\- 2013 North America market: Carrier 17%, Daikin 15%, Trane 10%, Johnson 9%, Lennox 6%, LG 5%.\n\n\\- 2013 Global AC market: Daikin 13%, Carrier 10%, Johnson 8%, Trane/LG 4%.\n\n\\- 2018 Indian market share: LG 17,7%, Hitachi 7,9%, Daikin 7,4%.\n\n\\- HVAC Used by construction firms in USA: Carrier 29%, Lennox 17,3%, Daikin 8,2%, Trane7,3%, LG 1,8% Johnson 1,8%.\n\n\\- 2020 global “Wall-Mounted Fan Coil Units” market: Daikin 29%, Trane 26%, Carrier 12%, Johnson 7,5%\n\nMy conclusion from this and other information found online is that globally Daikin is the biggest followed by Carrier, Johnson, Trane, LG and Lennox. I accounted for all known acquisitions since 2013 in the market share.\n\n**An introduction to the Companies**\n\n**Carrier**\n\nCarrier products and related services include HVAC and refrigeration systems, building controls and automation, fire and special hazard suppression systems and equipment, security monitoring and rapid response systems, provided to a diversified international customer base principally in the industrial, commercial and residential property and commercial transportation sectors.\n\nEmployees: 53,000+\n\nCountries active: 160+\n\nMarket Cap: 25,959B\n\n**Key points:**\n\n\\- 85% of sales are in the USA or Europe, they are however planning to expand globally.\n\n\\- 51% HVAC, 29% Fire and Security, 20% Refrigeration.\n\n\\- Since April 2020 carrier has split off from Raytheon Technologies, allowing them to focus fully on the HVACR market.\n\n\\- Carrier is planning on cutting 600million in costs by 2022 (4% of current COGS)\n\n\\- Carrier has recently launched its “BlueEdge” platform, providing aftermarket service to customers and minimizing machinery downtime &amp; costs.

Also, Johnson had some fuckery going on in all their 10k’s so these numbers might not add up, let me know if you found something.\n\nLooking at the company’s financials and numbers it’s a tough decision to make, all companies a pretty close to each other. There are however some things that stand out:\n\n\\- Carrier has a significantly higher NPM then the competitors.\n\n\\- Lennox might be in financial trouble.\n\n\\- Daikin spends the most on R&amp;D relative to its revenue, I see this as a big plus.\n\n\\- Johnson their revenue is growing the fastest on a 5Y CAGR.\n\n\\- Johnson their P/E is much higher than the competition.\n\n\\- Johnson their Dividend is the higher % wise\n\n\\- Daikin has increased sales in 2020 while other companies have seen a drop.\n\n\\- Daikin’s NPM is stable at around 8% while Carrier’s NPM has grown explosively. \n\n\\- Trane has a high debt/equity ratio\n\n\\- Both Carrier and Daikin have a very strong Interest coverage ratio.\n\n\\- Johnson's TTM would be better without an irregular expense of 602M\n\nNow on to the less financial aspect of the data.\n\nI really like the way Daikin presents their annual report, they have clear strategies on how to better engage the Indian market. They are also showing that they know where their market growth protentional lays and are willing to act on it. Furthermore, what really strikes me as interesting is that Daikin produces materials for semiconductor testing, this might be a goldmine in the upcoming tech revolution and Daikin has shown to be well aware of this upcoming trend. Carrier on the other hand has not properly breached the Asian/Middle eastern market yet, they have stated to expand their geographical presence but I have found no conclusive strategies in how to do so. What is impressive about carrier is their high net profit margin and willingness to act on a more digital environment, an area where Daikin is currently lacking.\n\nTo conclude this research properly, if I had to choose a company right now, I’d being going for Daikin. Their well-presented data and goals for emerging markets, combined with their semiconductor products make me believe they are most suited for rapid growth. Their geographical location also puts them in a better position for Asian dominance. And their Goodman sub brand is well known in America and a direct competitor to Carrier. Carrier is a close second, with impressive brand recognition and attractive financials. One thing carrier does well that Daikin does not is transport refrigeration. In my opinion trucking is going to play a much larger role when self-driving trucks start to appear.",

The truck is the jumping off point for the drone and then the pair will meet after the delivery is complete. The truck features a control center for the driver and auto-landing HorseFly roof with charging capabilities.\n* Recent updates to the drone allow for point-to-point package delivery without the need for a c1000\n* Reduces per package last-mile cost by up to 95% (\\~$0.04 per mile vs. \\~$1.00 for gas vehicle)\n* The recently granted HorseFly™ patent covers any drone utilization integrated with conventional vehicle\n* COVID-19 accelerated e-commerce experimentation and adoption with contactless drone deliveries\n\n## Additional Projects\n\n* Metron:  cloud-based, remote management system to manage and track the performance of all of the vehicle as a real-time solution for fleet managers\n* Aeres Delivery App -  a custom HorseFly user control center.

Additionally, Workhorse will receive a royalty fee for each electric pickup truck delivered by Lordstown. (Should they actually make one.)\n* The global Electric Vehicles Market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% from 2019 to 2026”.  Per FACTS &amp; FACTORS\n* ARK forecasts that EV sales should increase roughly 20-fold from \\~2.2 million in 2020 to 40 million units in 2025\n* ARK estimates that at some point during the next five years, drones will deliver more than 20% of parcel shipments.\n* ARK believes that drone delivery platforms will generate roughly $275 billion in delivery revenues, $50 billion in hardware sales, and $12 billion in mapping revenue by 2030.\n\n**Who’s In(vested)?**\n\nInstitutional Ownership: 45.81% (Yahoo)\n\n* Blackrock (6.05%)\n* Vanguard (4.29%)\n* Ark Invest (3.24%) \\*\\*\\* Yes Timmy, I know they unloaded their shares.\n* Robeco (3.22%)\n* Invesco (2.38%)\n\n## Comps\n\nIt is Workhorse’s expectation that the non-traditional OEMs will compete head-to-head with the likes of GM, Daimler and Ford in the sub 600 cubic feet class, while the 650 - 1200 cubic feet cargo capacity space is left largely ignored. The main reason being that vehicles over 10000 lbs require a Professional driver and costs associated with increase in skill required.\n\nWorkhorse is focused in BOTH the 650-1200 cubic feet range AND 10000lb+ gvw class.\n\nI found that information **hidden away in a scroll called a \"10-k\"**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Traditional OEMs\n   * Ford eTransit/GM EV600 both have 600 cubic feet cargo capacity or less. Late 2021 production.\n   * Freightliner has both the ECascadia (class 8) and eM2 (class 6-7)\n   * Mercedez-Benz ESprinter (Only 96 mile charge; Looking for 100+ in North America. Although Mercedez partnered with Matternet for drone optimization, the WKHS’s US patent should impair operations.)\n* Non-Traditional OEMs\n   * Rivian (Amazon contract; 10,000 pounds or less)\n   * Chanje v8100 (650 cubic feet cargo capacity)\n   * Bollinger Deliver-E (Production set to begin 2022; no blue chip names announced)\n\n## SWOT Analysis\n\n* Strengths\n   * Patents/Trademarks\n   * All electric OEM (made in America)\n   * Strong congressional support in OH\n   * Already have actual product\n* Weaknesses\n   * Historically poor production (prior management)\n   * Low staff count (during COVID they didn’t have enough staff to assemble vehicles despite backlog of thousands of vehicles)\n   * Connection to Steve Burns\n* Opportunities\n   * Expected CAGR of both EVs and Drones over the next decade\n   * 10% equity stake in RIDE (+ royalties on any future sales if they occur)\n* Threats\n   * Never mass produced all electric C1000 or C650\n   * EV market does not rapidly expand\n   * Not a cash-positive company from direct operations\n\n## Conclusion + Position\n\n* My Position: 850 shares @ $13.89 average cost per share/$12.30 \"adjusted\" cost basis after selling covered calls Feb-April (message for screenshot if necessary; no problem!)\n* I originally discovered Workhorse digging through daily ARK invest movement emails. I found it interesting to see Cathie grabbing extraordinary amounts of shares in the company so I looked further into them. I was disappointed to see them exit their position but I have added an additional 200 shares to my portfolio since I found out.\n* Workhorse was probably way ahead of itself when it reached $40. That doesn't make it \"Deadhorse\" just because it missed out on one government contract. The government will need electrified fleets; Workhorse might stand a chance, who knows.\n* I miss flying my drone. I crashed it into a darn tree and ever since videos of the Horsefly on youtube have had to fill the void. Not the same, but it's like watching an airplane play Tetris.\n* I did not provide a list of catalysts - use the google machine\n\n## Exit Strategy\n\n* No.\n\nDisclaimer: **I am not a financial advisor**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nedit: format issues\n\nedit2: format issues again\n\nedit3: i think i fixed the format issues",

            "text": "I understand this will be going above your autistic heads, but try to learn to read for just 5 minutes here.\n\nYour 11 year bull market that thrived on low interest rates, and low unemployment encouraged a lot of big dick financial risk taking behavior by large corporations who similar to us kept saying \"Can't go tits up.\" This in turn led to a corporate debt bubble that was highlighted as \"Risky\" by the federal reserves November 2019 financial stability report.\n\n&gt;Business debt levels are high compared with either business assets or GDP, with the riskiest firms accounting for most of the increase in debt in recent years.\n\nWhen companies rack up large amounts of debt, they sell them to cucks as Corporate Bonds. This is known as the corporate bond market. Cucks who own corporate bonds make money by being paid in interest on those bonds.\n\nBut what happens when you have a global pandemic where businesses are forced to shut down for an undermined amount of time? Revenue streams dry up and those companies are now at risk of being unable to pay out the interest payments to the bond holders. This results in a default. Once a company defaults creditors set out on horses with massive dildos to fuck the life out of these companies and force them into bankruptcy. Usually by selling off all their assets to pay back the bond holders and creditors.\n\nThere are corporate bond ETF's that you can buy puts on, and that's probably what I'll put most of my money into.

            "title": "$ESTC Soon to Rise, an unrecognized beneficiary of the Fortune 500's E-Commerce Transition",
            "text": "**Storytime**\n\nOn April 27th, Mark Cohodes, a well-known short seller and investor, mentioned his [bullishness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cBmxH295K8) on Camping World. His thesis was that people—needing a socially and medically acceptable form of escape / recreation—would turn to RVs and the outdoors, resulting in dramatic sales increases. Since his interview, CWH has doubled in value from \\~$8 to \\~$18. Mark was able to look at an obvious shift (quarantine) in behavior and identify a non-obvious beneficiary (RV / outdoor equipment sellers). This is a great mindset when it comes to generating plays.\n\nHere, we’ll take a look at another obvious shift and discuss a non-obvious beneficiary, Elastic N.V. (**ESTC**). I believe that ESTC will see it’s stock price rapidly appreciate after June 3rd, when ESTC’s earnings reveal that it’s highly undervalued compared to peers.\n\n***TL;DR Buy ESTC for an undervalued tech play that capitalizes on increased traffic for online commerce/site search, as well as a shift to work from home (all due to COVID)***\n\n***This is SHOP/TWLO electric boogaloo, except you’re getting in while it’s hella cheap***\n\n**Thesis Breakdown**\n\n1. **Shift in market demand due to COVID**\n2. **Examples of this shift evident from other tech company earnings reports**\n3. **Why ESTC is poised to benefit from this shift/said tech companies**\n4. **ESTC competitors and why ESTC shines**\n5. **Why ESTC is undervalued compared to peers**\n6. **Potential ER outcomes and implications for market valuation**\n7. **Play recommendations**\n8. **Positions**\n\n**The COVID Shift**\n\nIt’s no secret that consumer spending is shifting online. Online sales growth has been accelerating at 13+% YoY—and those numbers are pre- Covid-19. Now that businesses are being *forced* to move online, this process will accelerate in a virtuous cycle: more online businesses = more options for consumers = more online spending = more market for businesses = more online businesses. This shift has already largely occurred for big companies, but now this cycle will accelerate for small and medium sized companies.\n\nTo be successful here, it is crucial not only to provide consumers more options to appeal to their needs and convert to sales, but to also be able to understand user preferences by observing patterns in their browsing, so you can personalize presented options for optimal sales growth as well as customer retention. The incentives to improve customer retention/experience will help consumers lean in more to e-commerce.\n\nThe second part of the shift is that manye companies are focusing on WFH (work from home) and are responding to new needs to support such a paradigm shift. Obviously, these companies will need firewalls, endpoint protection, security etc. as well as needing better ways to manage remote collaboration and access to files/documents from unsecured locations that may not have all the protections a “secure facility” like an office workplace, has established. Indexing and searching those files/documents is just another example of how search becomes relevant\n\n**Evidence of the COVID Shift in Tech Earnings**\n\nLet’s think about the *less obvious* implications of this combined shift. What companies stand to benefit from continued WFH and from a massive spike in ecommerce / site usage? \n\nI’ll list some examples of companies that have seen extraordinary usage increases that are now reflected in their market valuation from recent earnings reports\n\n1. SHOP reflecting a surge in both online sellers and online revenue sales\n2. TWLO reflecting a massive surge in companies trying to reach customers more proactively\n3. FSLY reflecting a huge surge in online content traffic\n4. DDOG reflecting a huge increase in monitoring/data analytics needs\n5. MDB reflecting a huge increase in demand for cloud databases\n\nI can go into detail on every single company above, but why don’t I just let you take a look at how these companies are doing recently.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/susf6cka94051.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=21301456662c0dc5be2d8b603623a81c085ba440\n\nSo what in the hell is going on? Every company dipped during COVID as you can see, some reaching as low as half of the peak valuation they had pre-COVID in the massive bull run we saw beginning of 2020. Only to blow their previous all time highs out of the water in a massive rebound!\n\nWhy?  \nThe common theme is massive beats on earnings reports, in some cases being almost complete surprise profits vs loss expectations, with a general 5-15% revenue surprise beat\n\n1. SHOP was expected to have a .17c loss for Q1, only to beat with a 19c profit!\n2. DDOG was expecting a 2c loss, only to have a 6c profit\n3. TWLO was expecting an 11c loss only to have a 6c profit\n4. FSLY was expecting 12c loss only to have a 6c loss\n5. MDB’s earnings was last in January, so does not reflect COVID gains, however has been benefiting from perception around its demand\n\nThe source of these surprises is because people underestimated the COVID shift which has benefited these companies massively and acted as tailwinds vs the analyst perceived headwinds. \n\nNow let’s get to the point of the article, who else can benefit from all the above shifts we described? Let me introduce you to Elastic, a company whose product you use literally everyday without knowing and benefits from the previously proven shifts.\n\n**The Beneficiary**\n\nElastic provides a (freemium) open source software stack which allows searching within apps / websites. Elastic is to Uber what Google is to the internet. To further explain the necessity of this product, I’ll [quote](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5498841ce4b0311b8ddc012b/t/5e4703048934db2c06ec56ae/1581712134756/Greenhaven+Road+Letter+%282019+Q4%29.pdf) Scott Miller of Greenhaven Road Capital: \n\n“*The simplest form of search is a search box on a website like Cooking.com where users go to search the library of recipes. However, with thousands of recipes indexed on the site, how should search results be ordered? What should be included? Do you allow for misspellings? Synonyms? If you are in charge of optimizing search results on Cooking.com, you can build your own search tool or integrate with the extensive built-in functionality of Elasticsearch.*” \n\nScott continues to make the prescient point that for companies like Uber and Tinder, **“*****search \\[and the data it generates\\] is the product*****.”** For years, Elastic has been a vital component of the world’s most popular apps and business websites. Take a look at some of Elastic’s customers here, and note that they are all big dogs:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbieql0g94051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2cd658861323b3f7993744ae86270705374f41b\n\nShopify, Uber, Stack Overflow (Twilio too, though not pictured)… all told, **over 32%** of the Fortune 500 use Elastic to power mission-critical search apps. Even the peerless brokerage Robinhood—known for its elite technological focus—turns to Elastic. Also, while it is not listed explicitly, many other companies you know of also use them like Netflix, LinkedIn, Slack and more. Google a company and elastic search and you’ll probably find a blog post about how they use it. \n\nAs part of it’s support, Elastic has a holistic stack referred to as ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana) that power a multitude of the needs that go beyond just supporting search, but also processing the data/logs, monitoring it, and visualizing it to identify patterns that can serve as opportunities for enhancing customer/product experience. Their services can be used to index content for websites referred to as site search, but they also have a flavor of the service focused on Enterprise search to enhance workplace productivity.\n\nAs thousands of companies increasingly shift to online-only, WFH, and dealing with more site usage, they have two options: improve in-house search tools, or turn to a provider. That means that the company which is able to be the best provider will win over these customers and benefit greatly—they’ll be the “Camping World” of *this* shift. \n\n**Who are Elastic’s competitors in the market?**\n\nIf you have the above needs, you will end up using either Elastic, Splunk, or Amazon Elasticsearch (which I’ll cover in the next section) to serve your needs. Let’s table Amazon for now (don’t freak out just yet) and establish Elastic as better than Splunk first. \n\nFirst, Elastic’s pricing is much more forgiving than Splunk’s—vitally important given the current economic reality. Elastic recently [lowered](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-service-on-elastic-cloud-introduces-new-pricing-with-reduced-costs) its non-enterprise grade pricing over 60% to $16.40 a month, which will be extremely appealing to cash-strapped businesses. And ESTC’s enterprise grade product is far cheaper than Splunk’s, which is priced at $2000 a year, minimum. \n\nFurther, Elastic has been designed from day-one as a full text search engine (as opposed Splunk’s machine-data parsing focus). This is better suited to the needs of non-tech businesses who are now trying desperately to give customers a satisfactory web experience. You can make your own determination based on the information in this comparison:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvys389j94051.png?width=441&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7f9ec2c7d2b7de6927e7e829add9606fb90545a\n\nFinally, I think that [Elastic enterprise search](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdefrancesco/2019/09/29/elastics-core-search-technology-powers-multiple-growth-levers/#6602f87b784a) is a great addition to Elastic’s offerings. Enterprise search “gives users the ability to explore content across common SaaS-based data sources (including Google Drive, GitHub, Salesforce and Dropbox) from a single search box.” For companies coordinating both WFH and shifting online, this will be a huge boon, as a single searchable repository massively improves efficiency. \n\nNow let’s tackle Amazon. Before you go piss your pants, note that this is one case where Amazon is out of its element and has been unsuccessful despite being in market for almost five years already. \n\nFirst, Amazon only became a competitor to Elastic by essentially copying it in an unethical but very Amazon-like [manner](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/) (software strip-mining). However, I’m bullish on ESTC’s chances of wooing new businesses even in light of Amazon’s sketchiness: ESTC has shown willingness to [fight](https://searchaws.techtarget.com/news/252471650/AWS-faces-Elasticsearch-lawsuit-for-trademark-infringement) in the courts, and they, [like MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/press/mongodb-issues-new-server-side-public-license-for-mongodb-community-server) (which is now at ATH despite Amazon), have other methods of continuing to be open-source while impeding unsavory appropriation from competitors. Further, Elastic has an extreme focus on R&amp;D investment, meaning that Amazon cannot dedicate as many resources purely to search (and the dataviz that results from it, etc.). Lastly, ESTC actually can provide direct support for Elastic as a product (being the developers) whereas Amazon can only provide support for the AWS component of their service. All of this results in Amazon having far fewer notable clients despite debuting in 2015! Prime video is literally the most recognizable brand here from a consumer POV and they HAVE to use it:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/doaxhbnm94051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a4bbd7afba5b7a3a791baf900adcdf47c518e3b8\n\nDon’t believe me that it’s fine to compete with Amazon? Here’s Shay Bannon, Elastic CEO, on their last earnings call:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r40trvzo94051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fbea310253091c0c731fdffd5cb6c02bdbd1779b\n\nIn my opinion, Elastic will be the clear winner of this three-horse race, already beating Amazon and likely to beat Splunk. That’s great, because it will accelerate Elastic’s two drivers of value: **existing customer spend and new customer acquisition.** \n\n**Existing Customer Spend**\n\nElastic’s customers *love* the product. According to their [Q3 filing](https://s2.q4cdn.com/265747582/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q3-FY20-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf), Elastic’s Net Expansion Rate was over 130%, meaning that existing customers spent 30% QoQ on Elastic. This metric has actually exceeded 130% for **12** consecutive quarters. Can you imagine a service that you would triple your spend on every twelve months (except Robinhood FDs)\n\nKeep in mind that this is how well they do in a *pre-COVID* world—existing customers should spend *even more* this quarter due to the COVID shift and a desire to cater to customers more and more. Having the analytics to optimize customer experience and retain them is priceless in this economy, add in that Elastic employs a pricing philosophy where you pay for the [resources and data you use](https://www.elastic.co/pricing/philosophy) (plus support / consulting fees), and the incentives are very aligned. Validating this theory, client companies like Shopify and Twilio have emphasized an increased focus on data usage in recent presentations (images taken from Shopify’s IP and Twilio’s most recent 10-Q, respectively):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ro2aaawt94051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2b53f8d1e125f91b9289d198318bf24d64361ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x575j0au94051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bf716663d9035f83d95fe8311315e66f6ab4d46\n\n**Instacart**, Udemy, **Robinhood**, **Shopify**, Slack, **Datadog**, GitHub Soundcloud, F-commerce, **Fiverr,** **Twilio, Fastly, Uber(**eats**), etc.**: these are just a *handful* of companies which have seen usage dramatically increase. That means that they should be using ESTC even more, too and earning even more revenue.\n\n**New Customer Acquisition**\n\nElastic was able to increase its total number of customers by 8% QoQ in Q3. This was a continuation of a positive customer growth trend, reporting gains of 700, 900, and 800 customers QoQ (adding up to 10,500 paying customers today). Elastic is good at attracting big accounts. Accounts over **100k/y** have seen quarterly increases of 35, 50, and 45 QoQ to 570 today. Further, Elastic’s will continue to have a massive customer base from which to draw new customers. The ELK stack has over 500 million downloads, so there is a pretty obvious path to growth assuming customers can be converted—which they have shown that they can do. And as is argued above, Covid should be a huge accelerant towards converting more. \n\nAlso, people will be incentivized to convert because ESTC is intelligently focusing on other solutions these customers *need*. These include infrastructure monitoring and [SIEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management) applications. To further bolster these solutions, they’ve made prescient acquisitions, like [Endpoint Protection](https://www.elastic.co/about/press/elastic-completes-the-acquisition-of-endgame-a-leader-in-endpoint-protection) in 2019 (which, by the way, is a direct blow to Splunk). Additionally, revenue from the professional services (essentially customer support) category increased 43+% QoQ, showing that they aren’t ignoring the importance of the customer support driver. In these dire times, this number will only increase—many companies literally **cannot afford** to have their search fail. When businesses are online, it is all the more important to retain customers and maintain their purchasing habits, particularly as customers are more highly conscious of their breadth of options.\n\n**Financials:**\n\nEven before Covid, there was no question that demand for ElasticSearch was growing. Simply look at their accelerating revenue and gross profit generation, which is driven ( 90+%) by Elasticsearch subscribers. We’re seeing 40+% growth, every year, without fail, and with margin maintenance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7od2p2gx94051.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bfb6214981f1e336a829c714e0633a87e470a13\n\n[Put another way](https://twitter.com/richard_chu97/status/1262097677883506695): “ESTC’s dominance is also reflected in their ability to sustain revenue growth around 60% w/ accelerating SaaS revenues: 70% -&gt; 106% -&gt; 114% which now form 22% of revenues vs 17% a year ago. SaaS has slightly lower gross margins, but overall GM has still stayed stable around 74%.” \n\nAdditionally, it’s important to point out that, due to their financial calendar, the next filing will incorporate 2 months of “Covid earnings” as opposed to only one for companies like DataDog, because Q4 2020 ER on 6/3 reflects February-April, vs Jan-March as most companies we mentioned above. That’s a double dose of COVID spikes meaning even more impressive gain opportunities!\n\nThey aren’t yet profitable (which should appeal to an autist), which is often held against them. But in all seriousness, this is not always bad—think of early Amazon. Like Amazon, Elastic spends a ton on R&amp;D, rather than expansion:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dcs9zszz94051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f2412f4c6019d135a8755dc300848e2483d4eda\n\nAnd despite R&amp;D spend, operating margins are trendings in the right direction: -27% -&gt; -18% -&gt; -18%. IMO, the question is not “if” but “when” ESTC becomes profitable, and they (like Shopify, for instance) may achieve profitability this quarter if R&amp;D expenses are constant while revenue due to increased usage improves their bottom line (post COGS of course). \n\n**All Search and No Play Makes Stack A Dull Toy**\n\nSo here’s the **play**. ESTC’s stock has somewhat recovered from the impact of Covid, but it’s still \\~5% below where it was at its last ER at the end of February when it had a triple beat that sparked a 30% ER spike from 63$ open to 81$ high before settling near 70.\n\nThat’s despite many of its PTs being in the $80 - $100 range. However, because of the vast usage increase for their product which should occur from the en masse shift of WFH and web usage, it deserves an appreciation in price, not mere recovery.   \nConsider its peers are all at all time highs that are 20-30, some cases 100% higher than their previous peak, and if there is another big beat across the board, or surprise profit, ESTC will likely have a similar run with series of upgrades and continuous rise up towards high end of its PT\n\nPreviously, this stock has traded at 20x+ revenue. Currently, it’s at around 14-15x, which is not accounting for the fact that this crisis should be *helpful*—and nor is it accounting for a [stellar Q3](https://s2.q4cdn.com/265747582/files/doc_financials/2020/q3/Q3-FY20-Earnings-Press-Release.pdf), which was somewhat lost in the sauce. Keep in mind that stellar Q3 just had a 7c beat on earnings, and raise in guidance, and caused SP to rise 30%. Imagine what a COVID fueled beat and raise could do for the SP?  \nI think this will all be reflected by the June 3rd ER. Additionally, it’s worth noting that ESTC has had a recent run of beats:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/md5i1m43a4051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d372211deb9dcae89ec549980491cb7529827d75\n\nUltimately, ESTC has an unfairly low EV to revenues when compared to competitors. I think this might start to shift as their strategy which has been viewed historically as unclear, shows that it is paying off with customer traction and COVID tailwinds to approach profit in 2021 FY (2020 Calendar Year):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/71e16x75a4051.png?width=512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cefde9ecb1e1582235ad808246ebc28388554f29\n\nIf they do beat similar to last quarter, and/or provide optimistic guidance for 2021 FY forecasts, it’s possible ESTC could surge another 20-30% into the 90s—this would put its price in line with historical averages. In any case, its average PT from analysts is \\~$84.\n\nInstitutions and smart money know this. This past quarter, ESTC has been among the [top ten](https://twitter.com/HedgeMind/status/1258842785467084800) stocks hedge funds have increased stakes in. Additionally, I don’t think this is fully priced in yet: IV is similar to its [historical pre-earnings levels](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/ESTC/IV/) and likely will be inflated due to COVID related market volatility.\n\nGay bear case: \n\n1. Free cash flow and cash from operations have been down in the past few quarters. \n\n2. ESTC faces stiff competition\n\n3. Their biggest moat is probably the fact that, because they are open source, they have hundreds of thousands of independent developers—but that’s also their biggest weakness (e.g. people can misconfigure Elastic Stack causing data breaches).  \n\n4. SAAS companies may now be “priced to perfection.”\n\n5. Elastic is prone to having human error related “data breaches” because people don’t know how to configure it to actually keep data private, this is getting better but you still see reports regularly of morons from high profile companies that fucked up. \n\nObviously, I’m bullish. But as always, look into the pros and cons and *do* *your own* DD!\n\nIf you’re **searching** for a play (yes I am gay), this might be it. \n\nTL;DR**:** \n\n**$ESTC** \n\n**6/19 $75 C safest low risk**\n\n**6/19 $80 C if you want more risk / reward.** \n\n**6/19 $85 C and above True wsb Yolo.**\n\n**If you’re a more sophisticated brand of autist, spreads may be a nice way to lower your cost basis and avoid IV crush while still capturing high moon potential**\n\n**P.S. if you’re on the fence, Splunk has ER after hours today, should be good signal of how ESTC does and it may get a boost from a beat there**\n\nMy positions: \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1l9ewsn8a4051.png?width=1408&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f2cb8e0266b4b1c8580b9371fa8900b10af53388",

            "title": "I think PLTR is invincible rn and in the long run.",
            "text": "So... this could be a bit long, but let me double down  on my thoughts on PLTR. Recently, we’ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.\n\nA lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don’t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.\n\nNow we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us 🦍 have to be wary of.\n\nAs much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market’s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We’ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.\n\nAnd well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.\n\nSo here’s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn’t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.\n\nBut that’s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.\n\nNow, the thesis is that growth firms’ future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here’s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.\n\nLet’s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).\n\nEssentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.\n\nBut think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.\n\nThey faced the same problems. I’m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn’t have the cash to survive in the EV market.\n\nI watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. \nHe shore could.\n\nYes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn’t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain’t cheap. \n\n(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).\n\nAnd if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. \n\nIs it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.\n\nBut no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes 🤮🤡.\n\nFuck the shills who say Palantir can’t continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).\n\nOn top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov’t clients at roughly 52%, but let’s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don’t want to get too political here, but broadly, you’re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).\n\nNot too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there’s honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.\n\nAnd let’s take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.\n\nGiven PLTR traces its roots to the CIA’s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.\n\nFurthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.\n\nThe answer is yes. But Wall St doesn’t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren’t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don’t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‘98 Honda Accord (and that’s exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)\n\nBut we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir’s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.\n\nI believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.\n\nAnd I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.\n\nAs a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).\n\nFor disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.\n\nNow with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\n**UPDATED PART 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lr1l80/pltr_extensive_dd_part_2_what_makes_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf",

If only it accounted for the big event happening in the next 9 days (see news events below).\n\n**NEWS EVENTS**\n\n*FB settlement*\n\nI’m not going to go into deep detail here as it is quite intricate and all I know is that BB won a suit against fuckerberg $FB related to messaging, whatsapp, and something else. $FB has till January 15th, 2020 to settle, see here: https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.331602/gov.uscourts.cand.331602.144.0.pdf \n\nThis FB settlement is not included in earnings expectations, meaning THAT SHIT GOES UP or will be in analyst projections.\n\n*BlackBerry IVY - Intellectual Vehicle Data Platform*\n\nThe big kahuna that will change BB for the next few years. Per BB website: “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”\n\nWhat does it mean to the end consumer (the automakers?)\n\n**IVY Fueling Business Outcomes**\n\nBlackBerry IVY will help automakers and automotive suppliers:\n\nFuel Innovation by supporting rapid development of new customer experiences\nDrive Revenue by unlocking new revenue streams and business models\nReduce Costs by moving processing to the edge &amp; reducing raw data transmission\nImprove Operations with enhanced data visibility and access\nExpand Ecosystems by unlocking the broader app developer community\n\n\nWanna watch a video?

Cybersecurity adding onto big big platforms that exploded this past year. MORE MONEY you dumbasses.\n\nPatents\nBB started offloading old patents but have one that will be important as of recent, with the sexiest one being this: https://uspto.report/patent/grant/10880812 \n\nVery pretty stuff, big sex.\n\n\n**Business Implications**\n\nBB makes their money from licensing, cybersecurity (one of the only companies that have not been hacked in this SolarWind shit), BB QNX is already in 175 MM cars worldwide, partnered with XPEV, and is in talks with multiple Tier 1 automakers, 20 different OEMs, and will be in vehicles by 2023. Does that mean anything now? Yes, you dumbass. Per CEO John Chen, my new president, #DidYouKnow @BlackBerry has been selected by 19 of the top 25 #ElectricVehicle manufacturers, and they represent 61% of the Electric Vehicle market?\n\nBubblicious and sexy. Expect some of the big tier 1s like Nissan, Toyota, BMW, and others to jump on this train. Think TSLA doesn’t have competition? Bitch they cant even make a billion dollars unless they sell stock (which since MS just upgraded their price, I bet they offer at least $5B in stock in the coming days).\n\n**CONFERENCES**  \n\nBB is speaking at the following conferences:\n\nCiti’s 2021 Global TMT West Virtual Conference - Thursday January 7th, 2021 at 1 PM with the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \n\nJP Morgan 19th Annual Tech / Auto Forum\nTuesday January 12th, 2021 at 5:45 PM ET \nwith the Steve Rai, Blackberry CFO  and John Wall, Co-Head of BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) \nLINK: https://gentherm.gcs-web.com/events/event-details/19th-annual-jp-morgan-techauto-forum \n\n\nNeedham’s 23rd Annual Virtual Growth Conference \nFriday, January 15th, 2021 at 1:15 pm ET \nWith Ryan Permeh, Blackberry Chief Security Architect &amp; Co-founder of Cylance and Eric Cornelius, Blackberry Chief Product Architect \n\nThis was just announced and you bet your ass this will pump this stock up.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis stock will generate a lot more cash in the coming years, will gain in the short term by offloading old patents, settling with FB and getting some moolah, growing in their partnership with Bezos gang, roll out to more EVs with Tier 1 and Tier 2 automotive companies, and compete with Tesla on this as well. This shit trades at $6.70 and is so close to going up if the market just doesn’t crash in the interim. They already are used by big companies for Access and other Mobile applications, so that someone can securely use their dinky iPhone to work. Think big whales aren’t interested? Look at 2022 2023 option OI. \n\nI think this goes to lower PT of $10 by May, more likely $15. uThInKitWiLLdOUbleINmKTcAp????

Only a few small sections of the massive general assembly building do not have roofing yet, and the same is true for Gigafactory 3’s walls. Around the facility’s grounds, workers continued their activities, and cement trucks were seen heading inside the massive factory, hinting at the work being started inside.  The pace of Gigafactory 3’s construction is unprecedented, and it is one that will likely make it to books in the future. China itself, which holds a solid reputation for quick, surgically-precise buildouts, will probably set records with the construction of Gigafactory 3. As Tesla’s electric car factory in Shanghai rises, it is pertinent to note that there was a time, not too long ago, when the idea of Gigafactory 3’s factory shell being completed in roughly five months was considered implausible.\n\n[Tesla adjusts Autopilot to comply with new EU regulations | May 17 2019](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/17/tesla-updates-autopilot-europe/)\n\nTesla will push an updated Autopilot in Europe that scales back on a couple of functions in order to comply with new regulations. The changes will require faster lane changes and limit how far you can turn the steering wheel on Autosteer. Electrek reports that while Tesla's Autopilot was approved under older rules, it had to be dialed back in order to comply with the new UN/ECE R79 regulation on driver assistance systems. The update only impacts Model S and Model X vehicles; Model 3 already complies with the new rules.\n\n[Tesla Completes Acquisition of Maxwell Technologies | May 16 2019](https://ir.tesla.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tesla-completes-acquisition-maxwell-technologies)\n\nAs of the expiration of the exchange offer, a total of approximately 36,764,342 shares of common stock of Maxwell were validly tendered in the exchange offer and not validly withdrawn, representing approximately 79% of the aggregate voting power of the shares of Maxwell common stock outstanding immediately after the consummation of the exchange offer.

CEO Elon Musk is turning to the insurance business in an attempt to achieve what the automaker has so far struggled with on the vehicle pricing front: lower costs for customers. Tesla says it will start offering insurance this month that taps internal data from the AutoPilot driver-assist system to reduce rates. Musk, on Tesla's first-quarter earnings call, said the product would \"be much more compelling than anything else out there.\"\n\n[Tesla (TSLA) closes its massive $2.7 billion capital raise to boost its cash position | May 8 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/05/08/tesla-tsla-closes-capital-raise/)\n\nTesla announced today that it closed its new capital raise yesterday and it was over-subscribed with underwriters selling the additional shares and notes for total proceeds of $2.7 billion to boost Tesla’s cash position.\n\n[Tesla (TSLA) is going to get up to $2 billion from Fiat-Chrysler to meet emission standards | May 7 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/05/07/tesla-tsla-2-billion-fiat-chrysler-emission-standards/)\n\nWe recently learned that Tesla and Fiat-Chrysler (FCA) reached a deal to pool their fleet together in Europe for the purpose of the latter avoiding emission requirement fines. It was first reported to be worth a few hundred million dollars, but FCA now says that it will pay Tesla up to $2 billion for the emission credits.\n\n[Elon Musk Confirms He Bought $25 Million in Tesla Stock Last Week | May 7 2019](https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-tesla-stock-buy-51557202259)\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed in a regulatory filing late Monday that he purchased $25 million of his company’s stock in a public offering last week. He bought the shares on Thursday, May 2. A form that Musk filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that he now owns 33,927,560 Tesla shares through the trust.\n\n[More Advanced Safety for Tesla Owners | May 2, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/more-advanced-safety-tesla-owners)\n\nThe massive amount of real-world data gathered from our cars’ eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and forward-facing radar, coupled with billions of miles of inputs from real drivers, helps us better understand the patterns to watch out for in the moments before a crash. As our quarterly safety reports have shown, drivers using Autopilot register fewer accidents per mile than those driving without it. That’s because Autopilot is designed to reduce fatigue by helping drivers stay in their lane, while also ensuring that they keep their hands on the wheel. While lane-keeping and hands-on monitoring can be extremely effective at helping to reduce the likelihood of an accident when Autopilot is in use, we believe that these precautions can also be extremely effective for preventing accidents when Autopilot is not in use. Today, we’re introducing two new safety features designed to help prevent drivers from inadvertently departing their lane, which our data shows is a common cause of accidents when Autopilot is not in use. These new features – Lane Departure Avoidance and Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance – help drivers stay engaged and in their lane in order to avoid collisions.\n\n[Elon Musk Makes $500 Billion Autonomy Pitch to Investors | May 2 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-05-02/musk-is-said-to-make-500-billion-autonomy-pitch-to-investors)\n\nThe chief executive officer said autonomy is a fundamental driver for Tesla and key to how it could become a “half-trillion dollar market cap company,” said the people, who asked not to be identified because the call wasn’t open to the public. A Tesla spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The comments build on the case that Musk made during an investor day focused on autonomy last week that Tesla is on the cusp of having 1 million vehicles on the road that will be fully capable of driving themselves. The billionaire plans to put those cars into a shared robotaxi service that the CEO described as being lucrative for both the company and its customers.\n\n[Tesla delays electric semi truck production to next year | Apr 25th 2019](https://electrek.co/2019/04/25/tesla-semi-delay-electric-truck-production-next-year/)\n\nDuring its first quarter 2019 earnings call last night, Tesla confirmed that it is delaying the production of Tesla Semi, its electric semi truck program, to next year. The executive also said that they are currently testing the electric trucks with maximum loads and that they are making improvements to the design. Musk previously said that Tesla aims to manufacture 100,000 electric trucks per year. Over the past two years, Tesla has been taking reservations for the electric truck and said that the production versions will have 300-mile and 500-mile range versions for $150,000 and $180,000 respectively.\n\n[The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther | April 23 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther)\n\nBeginning today, Model S and Model X now come with an all-new drivetrain design that increases each vehicle’s range substantially, achieving a landmark 370 miles and 325 miles on the EPA cycle for Model S and Model X Long Range, respectively. Using the same 100 kWh battery pack, these design and architecture updates will allow drivers to travel farther than ever before, charging less frequently and getting more range out of every dollar spent on charging. We’re also introducing a brand-new adaptive suspension system for Model S and Model X, along with a few other improvements for the best range, acceleration, and ride comfort ever, plus a Ludicrous Mode upgrade for our most loyal customers.\n\n[Elon Musk said Tesla cars will probably be better than humans at driving by the end of 2019 | Apr 17 2019](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-predicts-tesla-cars-better-than-humans-at-driving-by-end-of-2019-2019-4?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=referral)\n\nTesla vehicles will likely be better at driving than humans by the end of 2019, CEO Elon Musk said in an interview with MIT research scientist Lex Fridman. \"I think it will become very quickly — maybe even towards the end of this year, but I would say I'd be shocked if it's not next year, at the latest — that having a human intervene will decrease safety,\" Musk said. Musk later said that Tesla's autonomous-driving technology was improving at an exponential rate, and that it seemed to him that the company is ahead of its competitors in the autonomous-driving industry.\n\n[Introducing a More Seamless Navigate on Autopilot | April 3, 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-more-seamless-navigate-autopilot?utm_campaign=NoA&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social)\n\nSince we first introduced Navigate on Autopilot last year, Tesla drivers have traveled more than 66 million miles using the feature, and more than 9 million suggested lane changes have been successfully executed with the feature in use. Today, we’re beginning to roll out our latest version of Navigate on Autopilot for a more seamless active guidance experience. In this new version, drivers will now have the option to use Navigate on Autopilot without having to confirm lane changes via the turn stalk.\n\n[Musk Hints Tesla Pickup Truck Will Make Ram Seem \"Puny\" | Mar 31, 2019](https://insideevs.com/news/343601/musk-hints-tesla-pickup-truck-will-make-ram-seem-puny/)\n\nOf course, we need some context here to explain what Musk is referring to, so here's the tweets:@RamLover69 You would still be physically fatigued if you tried to haul 12,000 lbs of steel beams like I do every day with my Dodge Ram, 2019s motor trend truck of the year.@elonmusk 12,000 lbs!? How puny. Do you construct children’s toys?It's not a secret that Tesla is working on an electric pickup truck. In fact, it's scheduled to be revealed sometime later this year. As for its towing/hauling abilities, both are still up in the air. However, we do know that the expectations are high...very high. The truck will be a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive pickup with \"crazy torque &amp; a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard,\" noted Musk in a previous tweet. We suspect that whatever a Ram 1500 or Ford F-150 can do, Tesla will one-up those figures.\n\n[Musk Says Tesla \\`Would Love to Be' in India This Year or Next | March 15 2019](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-03-15/musk-says-tesla-would-love-to-be-in-india-this-year-or-next)\n\nElon Musk isn’t giving up on bringing Tesla Inc. to India. “Would love to be there this year. If not, definitely next!” Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer said in a Twitter post, nearly ten months after he blamed restrictive policy for delaying the carmaker’s entry into the world’s fourth largest automobile market.\n\n[Tesla Model Y announced: release set for 2020, price starts at $47,000 | Mar 14 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264446/tesla-model-y-suv-compact-announcement-price-release-date-features-elon-musk)\n\nThe specs weren’t much of a surprise either: the long-range Model Y has a range of 300 miles and seating for seven. A performance version of the vehicle is capable of sprinting from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. “It has the functionality of an SUV, but it will ride like a sports car,” Musk said. “So this thing will be really tight on corners.” The $47,000 long-range Model Y will come first in the fall of 2020, and it will have a range of 300 miles, Musk said. Tesla will also sell an all-wheel drive dual-motor version for $51,000 and a performance version for $60,000 — both of which will be available in fall 2020. The cheaper, standard range version with a range of 230 miles won’t be available until 2021, Musk said. It will sell for $39,000.\n\n[Introducing V3 Supercharging | March 6 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)\n\nTesla has more than 12,000 Superchargers across North America, Europe, and Asia and our network continues to grow daily: more than 99% of the U.S. population is covered by the network, and we anticipate similar coverage in Europe by the end of 2019. Recently, we passed 90% population coverage in China and are growing that number quickly. V3 is a completely new architecture for Supercharging. A new 1MW power cabinet with a similar design to our utility-scale products supports peak rates of up to 250kW per car. At this rate, a Model 3 Long Range operating at peak efficiency can recover up to 75 miles of charge in 5 minutes and charge at rates of up to 1,000 miles per hour. Combined with other improvements we’re announcing today, V3 Supercharging will ultimately cut the amount of time customers spend charging by an average of 50%, as modeled on our fleet data.\n\n[Tesla’s Model 3 was the best-selling EV in the world last year | Feb 22 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236707/tesla-model-3-2018-best-selling-ev-global)\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling electric car in the world in 2018, according to data firm JATO Dynamics. JATO says the Silicon Valley automaker sold about 138,000 Model 3s, beating out contenders like the flagship EV of state-owned Chinese automaker BAIC (92,000) and the Nissan Leaf (85,000). In total, Tesla sold more EVs than any other automaker in 2018, JATO reports. The news comes at the same time that Tesla is starting deliveries of the Model 3 in China, the largest market in the world for electric cars. Tesla also recently started delivering Model 3s in Europe for the first time ever. Adding those new markets for the Model 3 is supposed to help Tesla increase sales of the car by more than 100,000 in 2019, according to recent estimates from the company.\n\n[Sentry Mode: Guarding Your Tesla | February 13 2019](https://www.tesla.com/blog/sentry-mode-guarding-your-tesla)\n\nAccording to federal statistics, there was an estimated one motor vehicle theft or attempted theft every 40.8 seconds in the United States in 2017— and that doesn’t even include the vast number of car break-ins that happen nationwide. Sentry Mode adds a unique layer of protection to Tesla vehicles by continuously monitoring the environment around a car when it’s left unattended. When enabled, Sentry Mode enters a “Standby” state, like many home alarm systems, which uses the car’s external cameras to detect potential threats. If a minimal threat is detected, such as someone leaning on a car, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alert” state and displays a message on the touchscreen warning that its cameras are recording. If a more severe threat is detected, such as someone breaking a window, Sentry Mode switches to an “Alarm” state, which activates the car alarm, increases the brightness of the center display, and plays music at maximum volume from the car’s audio system. If a car switches to “Alarm” state, owners will also receive an alert from their Tesla mobile app notifying them that an incident has occurred. They’ll be able to download a video recording of an incident (which begins 10 minutes prior to the time a threat was detected) by inserting a formatted USB drive into their car before they enable Sentry Mode.\n\n# [Leadership](https://ir.tesla.com/corporate-governance/management)\n\n**Elon Musk - CEO**\n\nElon oversees the company's product strategy -- including the design, engineering and manufacturing of electric vehicles and battery products for consumers.

            "title": "Massive DD Thread on $BODY. Deep Value for Investors.",
            "text": "Hello fellow Redditors! Here i will present you Due Diligence on a company i searched a lot and believe in it short and long term. Not only me but millions of people and huge names like **Shaquille o'Neal, Lebron James, and Arnold Schwarzenegger** since they are all shareholders in the company. The triple threat!!!\n\nI will try in this DD to mention with few words the most important things you need to know and ill try to do it in a way that wont get you tired to read all the post till the end! Clean and simple for you. I share this DD only to show new investors the Deep Value and potential this play brings to the market and nothing else... *After all everyone should search and add his own DD on top*. Who wouldnt like to find $NFLIX early as an investor? Life changing stocks should be found early. Have fun and invest with your own risk to lose or earn! Also **important, not bagholding!**\n\nLets start the story with an\n\n**Amazing All Star Management Team**:\n\nThe BeachBody team includes three former Disney senior executives — **Staggs, Mayer, and Salil Mehta**, its chief financial officer. Other directors, officers, and strategic advisors include Shaquille O’Neal, Peter Schlessel, Keith Horn, Sheila Stamps, Teresa Miles Walsh, and Martin Luther King III.Dont forget also Sue Collyns. No need to just mention that Staggs ([former Disney COO](https://variety.com/2016/biz/news/tom-staggs-disney-out-steps-down-bob-iger-1201745196/)) and Mayer (previously chairman of Disney’s Direct-to-Consumer and International and [briefly CEO of TikTok](https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/tiktok-kevin-mayer-resigns-1234750556/)) who both serve as co-CEOs and co-chairs of the board are higly valued and insightfull people along with all the others. Also worth mentioning that in the board also joined a member of **GME** board. Lastly CEO of the company is **Carl Daikeler** who managed to raise a company from VHS tapes to a behemoth that has 22 years of presence without debt and clears above 1+ billion in revenues. All star team with all star celebrities along their side each one valuable for their guidance. I will put some links from Shaqs and Arnold twitter along with Ross Gerber twitter who is bullish from Day 1 like he was in Tesla with their support in the company and the well respected Meet Kevin who is well known in Investing community.\n\n[https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/1407759264978931716](https://twitter.com/SHAQ/status/1407759264978931716)\n\n[https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1405573349896429570](https://twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1405573349896429570)\n\n[https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1407373786530271241](https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1407373786530271241)\n\n**Lets continue with what exactly $BODY brings to the market**:\n\nWell $BODY was a 3 way merger means you have BeachBody, Openfit and Myx Fitness all together.\n\n**BeachBody on Demand Interactive (BODi)**\n\nBeachBody, historically known for their workout DVD’s and many famous programs (P90x, Insanity, 21 Day Fix, etc), successfully made the transition to streaming On Demand. They are taking it a step further with the addition of BODi, live virtual classes. This additional feature is priced at $20/month on top of BOD which is currently $99/year. (Remember 89% margins on digital subscription revenue). Link to that article [here.](https://tbc-cms-prod-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/tbc-cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/19060123/BODi-Press-Release.pdf)\n\n**OpenFit PartnerShips**\n\nOpenFit (backed by Lebron &amp; Arnold) recently announced a partnership with Concierge Health, a technology platform that provides health engagement solutions to reduce healthcare costs. Concierge Health has a user base of 150M People, which will now have access to OpenFit and receive credit for completing workouts through the app. (Again, 89% margins) Link to that article [here.](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210609005208/en/Openfit-and-Concierge-Health-Announce-At-Home-Exercise-Incentives)\n\nOpenFit also has a partnership with LA Fitness over 700 physical locations , giving all of their gym members access to the app for $5/month. Link [here.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fitness-international-to-provide-its-members-with-openfit-the-all-in-one-digital-fitness-nutrition-and-wellness-platform-301277399.html)\n\n**Myx Fitness**\n\nA simple google search will show that MYX has the cheapest bike among competitors. Cheaper is obviously not always better, as a lot of times quality will suffer.But in our situation it seems that it is cheaper and better in quality than most of the competition. I have seen mostly good reviews and comments on social media about MYX bikes. The most negativity I've seen were complaints about shipping times, but also that customer service has been very responsive about this issue. A simple search will show you many people that dumped their old bike even it was more expensive for the Myx one. Interestingly, Myx has sold over 27,000 bikes in their first year of sales with the average user completing 15 workouts a month. The attractive pricepoint of their bikes at $1,299 is $600 cheaper than peloton’s basic bike.\n\n**Nutrition (thats a big one) Shakeology**\n\nShakeology is a superfood nutrition shake that can be a spark that prompts positive change in your life. They’ve also recently acquired Ladder in 2020, “the sports nutrition company founded by LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Ladder product is NSF Certified for Sport®, a third-party certification trusted by all major sports governing bodies and verifies that products do not contain any of approximately 270+ substances banned by major athletic organizations and that the contents of the product match what is printed on the label”\n\nYou can do a research on all of these on the official websites for more info.\n\nLets continue with\n\n**Quick Financial Overview:** 1.1B (est) revenue for 2021, 68% gross margins on that rev (which is better than NFLX, DIS, PTON, etc). Digital subscriptions have 89% margins. 43% YoY revenue increase for Q1. Added literally a million subscribers YoY. 400M free cash on the books upon merger w/ no debt. Also expanding to 10+ countries globally in the future starting with Spanish and French from now. Growth company and also tech company as you will see below in the post. Beach body already has more than 3.3 + **MILLION** paid digital subscribers. We will talk about subscribers, coaches and followers below. All in all, this is a financially solid company with plans for growth and expansion (in an industry that is expected to have a CAGR of 33% by 2027, $59B) which happens to have a few meme-like qualities and dont forget **NO DEBT.**\n\n**2021 Q1 Financials**\n\nTotal Revenue: $243M - 43% increase YoY\n\nTotal Subscriptions: 3.2M - 39% increase (record high)\n\n(Not an actual earnings report, assumed to be released after merger)\n\n**Q2** mentioned on interview will be even better.\n\n**Future Plans &amp; News**\n\nHere’s where they’re really making moves. Carl Daikeler (CEO of BB) and BeachBody has been operating on free cash flow and has been profitable for 20 years. Upon this deal closing, they’ll have what they referred to as a “war chest” of $400M free cash (with no debt) on the books for M&amp;A, marketing, and expansion.\n\n**International Expansion**\n\nThe team has recently stated plans of expanding worldwide to 10+ countries in the near future.\n\n**THATS IMPORTANT**. Lets make a break from facts and discuss numbers of followers and subscribers.\n\nIf you check company's website and social media and put all the followers together you will see that they have millions of followers, almost 3.4 million paid subs, thousands of coaches that each one have thousands of followers so again millions of people. Celebrities backing this one Lebron, Shaq, and Arnold together have 70 !!!! million followers only on Twitter, on Instagram they have over 100 million!!!!. Insiders have also thousands of followers, so here its good to say we speak about literally an army of people. **A cult that loves Beachbody.**\n\nImportant also is that Carl is a so well organized CEO that knows that BB has thousands of followers so as he mentioned lots of times he has well organized groups and teams in order to connect with each other, in order not to exist many groups on FB or any other social scattered all these people are well organized and managing thousands and millions of people, subs and coaches to connect each other.\n\nLets talk about\n\n**Tech in Fitness**\n\nAnytime you throw tech into an industry or sector, it instantly becomes more attractive. This is exactly what BB, MYX, and OpenFit are doing. 2020 saw a serious surge of fitness apps being downloaded. OpenFit has good ratings on the app store, 4.9 stars from 15k reviews. (App is also backed by Arnold and Lebron) People like the idea of being connected in their workouts, giving them the ability to compete with friends and strangers alike. There is a YouTube account called Garage Gym Reviews, this guy makes a living reviewing equipment and how that equipment will fit in your garage gym. He recently reviewed Tonal, and spoke on how tech connected fitness will be a huge market going forward. Some people will obviously not be able to afford to build a garage gym, or $3k Tonal, or an expensive exercise bike. This is where a $99/year BB subscription could come in.\n\nWhat about???\n\n**Future of At-Home Connected Fitness**\n\nWhy would people continue to workout from home after the pandemic is completely over? This is a valid question, but I fully believe people will continue to do so. A study conducted by Wakefield Research in July 2020 concluded that 87% (of 1000 participants) who plan to return to the gym say they will continue to work out at home at least some of the time. Links to those are [here](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200817005351/en/The-Future-of-Fitness-Americans-Embrace-a-Hybrid-of-Home-Exercise-and-Gym-Workouts) and [here](https://www.beachbodyondemand.com/blog/home-workouts-future-of-fitness). A survey of 3500 American by *The New Consumer* and Coefficient Capital found that 76% of people have tried working out at home during the pandemic—and crucially, 66% prefer it. Among millennials, the number is even higher: 82% made the switch and 81% like it more. Link to article [here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90587575/gyms-arent-coming-back-heres-how-youll-work-out-in-the-future).\n\nSay the truth who prefers working at his own pace with his own music and great programmes instead of being next to people especially after pandemic waiting for his turn on the bikes.\n\nLets see if there is any\n\n**Bear Case**\n\nNone. Only thing bears came in mind was something about MLM scheme but i wont discuss it since Kevin and Carl answered already on all their interviews *(Kevin Mayer and Carl Daikeler last interview on Fireside Chat : This is social commerce not MLM company , with influencers and no inventory on them. None intermediators , not MLM model at all.)* plus i wont mention MLM companies that their stocks are 50-100 pps because bears are getting nervous. *(HLF, NUS, PRI)*\n\nFinally most important\n\n**PAY ATTENTION TO THE Short Squeeze (summer lemonade) POTENTIAL**\n\n**Check this image**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[8.8&amp;#37; only public shares!](https://preview.redd.it/unkrgq17gh771.png?width=362&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6849de07ad327d6a808d1f44d4fc55147312d165)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMonday $BODY will have less than 30 milly shares available (around 22-25) for shareholders that makes it a very low float stock. Already buying pressure from retail is obvious. Already many tutes have positions with big names among them **74 total tutes, 65 long only**, 1 short only, 8 long/short with a total of 9 million shares already. As of 15/6 Short float was **20% !!!! in an already low floater**. Check this tweet for proof\n\n[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1404894383728730112)\n\nAdd all of the above to the equation and lets see...\n\nThe stock already hit 18+ back in February and since then shorts attacked it for several months creating 20% short float on a proven highly profitable growth company and dropping over 50% of its value. Now shares remaining are very low because **most float is locked**. Shorts need aprox. 8 days to cover and they getting trapped more and more every day and while trying to bash the stock everywhere in order to drop the price and get out since the dont have the shares to fight back the pressure. If everyone wants a little piece of this pie as it seems public float will be all locked fast and then ...\n\nDont forget Monday $BODY rings the bell and will attract more investors and retail plus all the cult behind this company as we mentioned above. This can creat a massive squeeze with shorts covering.\n\n**IMPORTANT--&gt;** Retail shareholders have high conviction and not selling shares, Carl already told that he wont sell even 1 share of his 41%, same applies for the insiders lots of them forgot to mention are unknown **Silicon Valley** investors. If they not selling, I’m not selling.\n\n**More MEMEish features**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* $BODY ticker (hard to ignore) [This](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/stock-picking-buying-a-winner-is-easy-just-find-a-cool-ticker-symbol.html) article details a study that concluded that companies with cool tickers tend to outperform the market better than companies without. Its summer anyways right?\n* Comparison to PTON\n* Arnold, Lebron, and Shaq are all confirmed shareholders. Collectively, they have 128.7M followers on IG alone. You can imagine what will happen if they start being vocal about their involvement in the company. Dont forget anything big Diesel touch along with the others turns to **gold**, no need to mention other tickers we all know. Who goes against these guys? Everyone loves them.\n* Kevin Mayer and Tom Staggs, both former Disney execs, will be staying on the BeachBody team to help with future growth, post-merge. Kevin Mayer played a large role in the success of Disney+, also former TikTok CEO\n* 1+ billion revenue that Carl on interview said that we should add one or two zeros in the future on that **without DEBT** at all and with 400m on chest for marketing and promotion.\n\nI dont want to post links to interviews and websites since we all know to google and search. All are available in youtube and www and i dont want to make this thread longer. **The only thing i will say is this DD thread was to put your attention on this company that as CEO mentions along with all shareholders, insiders and celebrities is the Biggest leading subscription Health and Wellness company offering Tech and Nutrition for the masses in the market. Its the PTON for 99% and the Netflix of digital fitness , all words from the all star team proven to turn into gold everything the worked with.**\n\nSome people say $BODY to 0, 5, 20, 30, 50, 100 i wont post or mention any pt but with so low float and so big Short float **everything is doable with volume**. Share thoughts share anything like i shared mine , and also i have to share my memeish feeling of the stock since day 1. Somewhere my eye caught a quote i liked - its better to be in a Meme before it becomes one (unknown - 2021)! First time such an all star team behind the wheel with so many followers behind them thats the fact. Shorts already seems to be in trouble into my eyes. **DEEP VALUE** my fellow apes rangers Ogs whatever you like. Everyone likes the stock it seems in social and you know the power of social media from Kitty.\n\n**Tip---&gt; No pumpers (yet) on $BODY its a pure fundamental - growth - behemoth of a company that offers huge potential to investors in early stages. They target triple digits and they are capable of as a team.**\n\n**Small Update : $BODY rang the bell this Monday 28/6.** But received many messages from people they couldnt find it to buy , thats because most brokers had issues since late at closing bell. From today 29/6 all will work fine. Despite all these issues on first day (that screwed some of the retail) $BODY opened strong and remained strong all day although more shorts piled in and raised SI more! (volume before price) As of today many brokers like IB have no shares available to short!!! Lastly i want to thank you for the feedback on the DD i really appreciate it, and the messages i got especially from people that know $BODY from inside!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBuAxovV\\_jM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBuAxovV_jM)\n\nBig thanks for taking some parts from the DD of Traditional-Studio-5 and some other BB followers. Any mistake i may not have seen please contact me to fix it asap since i double checked. Sorry for any typos also. Enjoy your investing journey!",

            "title": "Can someone make the positive Apple stock outlook make sense?",
            "text": "I am in my twenties and like many \"new\" investors became very interested in the market as a result of the economic downturn brought on by COVID-19. I saw a lot of my peers on Twitter and FaceBook making decent gains and it really piqued my interest because I have been saving roughly 4k per month in a high interest savings account and not really doing much else with it. I always thought the market to be too risky for my taste but after becoming comfortable with my base savings, I was ready to start my own journey into investing. I am not really the kind of person to go off of word of mouth so I set out to learn as much as I could on my own through reading and online courses. I took a course on the basics of the stock market on Udemy which mainly covered fundamental analysis but touched on the technical side of things as well. In addition to this I took a more in depth course on just technical analysis which covered trend lines, candlestick patterns etc ... I didn't find it too helpful for long term investments but it still seemed interesting. Lastly I read the Intelligent Investor as well as One Up on WallStreet and a book on basic accounting to help me understand how to decipher what I was seeing on these annual reports and what all of the numbers meant when I was attempting to valuate a potential purchase .... as well as various YouTube courses and tutorials\n\nAll of this has occurred over the course of the past 3 months, so while I have become a little more knowledgeable than most of my friends just blindly throwing money into the market, I still don't feel very confident in my newly developed skills because .... well, they are new and I haven't had enough experience.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME AND MY JOURNEY INTO THE STOCK MARKET, SKIP TO HERE:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith that being said, I have been seeing a lot of talk about this 4:1 Apple split that is coming up and while I understand that this doesn't change the company fundamentally at all, I really can't seem to see why Apple is trading for what it is ... or more importantly, why so many analysts are rating it as a \"buy\". I know that Graham specifically warns against needing validation from \"professionals\" for your decision making but since I am still really a newbie, I wanted to know if there is something I am missing in forming my opinion that the stock is severely overvalued.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is how I arrived at this conclusion:\n\n**Point 1:**\n\nIn my opinion, Apple is nothing more than a 1 dimensional hardware company. When you look at the annual report for FY 19' the revenue stemmed from the following:\n\n* iPhone Sales: 54.7%\n* Services: 17.8%\n* Mac: 9.9%\n* Wearables, Home, &amp; Accessories: 9.4%\n* iPad: 8.2%\n\nOut of all of these things, the only one that is not hardware is services which means that 82.2% of the sales come from hardware alone ... mainly iPhone.\n\nFurthermore, if you look at what exactly makes up this \"services\" category you will see that it is Apple Music, Apple Care, iCloud, App Store Subscriptions, and also baked in there is the free version of iCloud, Maps, and Siri.\n\nNow, while I respect apple for growing this particular vertical (services) of its company which has experienced some good growth over the last few years\n\n2017: $32,700M in sales\n\n2018: $39,748M in sales (increase of 21.55%)\n\n2019: $46,291M in sales (increase of 16.46%)\n\nI can't help but also realize how closely coupled the services vertical is to the hardware vertical. Mostly all of the services Apple provides depend on the successful sale of its hardware. I can speak personally that I cancelled Apple Music in 2017 for Spotify because I switched jobs (software engineer) to a position that required me to work in a secure environment where I couldn't bring in my phone and since Apple Music had no web app, I couldn't listen to music and code while at work. This makes me weary of their services business as a whole because if for some reason the hardware becomes less popular then the services will suffer severely it seems ... you don't really need Apple Music without an iPhone .... and you aren't really paying for app store subscriptions if you don't have an iPhone or Mac ... and you also don't need Apple Care without an Apple Device, see where I am heading?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\niPhone sales are plateauing which can be seen by the data leading up to 2018 as well as the official announcement from Apple that they would stop providing exact numbers on the numbers of units sold at the end of 2018.  Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276306/global-apple-iphone-sales-since-fiscal-year-2007/)\n\nIn addition to iPhone sales slowing up ... PC sales have been declining across the board for a while due to the fact that handhelds have become increasingly more powerful, this has also resulted in the plateauing of Mac sales as well. Data: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/276308/global-apple-mac-sales-since-fiscal-year-2002/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI say all of this to point out that for a company that is getting 82% of its sales from hardware, the hardware growth seems to be slowing down tremendously and the services market that it seems to be  shifting into seems largely dependent on the hardware, which seems concerning to say the least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Point 2:**\n\nApple does not appear to either be a growth stock or a value stock in the current climate. Don't get me wrong, I think Apple is pretty good company as a whole and they appear to clearly be financially stable  even despite the declining hardware sales ... but at this price they are far from a \"value\" stock and from a financial perspective, they don't seem to be a \"growth\" stock either.\n\nWhen you look at net income for the past 5 years you will notice that it hasn't really changed too much, when comparing the most recent annual report with the one from 5 years ago the net income has only increased by 3.5% which doesn't even take into account inflation which in actuality would make it seem like the net income for FY 19' was actually less than what was earned in FY 15'\n\n2015: $53.39B\n\n2016: $45.69B\n\n2017: $48.35B\n\n2018: $59.53B\n\n2019:  $55.26B\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, what seems funky to me is that the EPS actually seems to be increasing over time ... but it is not due to the net income rising, it is due to the fact that Apple has been buying back stock each year thus decreasing the total number of shares outstanding from 5.75B in 2015 to 4.62B in 2019, a decrease of 19.65% over the past 5 years ... this makes the EPS seem higher and the P/E seem lower, making the stock seem more valuable than it actually is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**SHARES OUTSTANDING:**\n\n2015: 5.75B\n\n2016: 5.47B (-4.87%)\n\n2017: 5.22B (-4.57%)\n\n2018: 4.96B (-4.98%)\n\n2019: 4.62B (-6.85%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: - 19.65%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPS (as is in annual report):**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $8.35 (-10.02%)\n\n2017: $9.27 (+11.02%)\n\n2018: $12.01 (+29.56%)\n\n2019:  $11.97 (-0.37%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +28.99%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EPS (based on consistent shares outstanding of 5.75B across all years)**\n\n2015: $9.28\n\n2016: $7.94 (-14.44%)\n\n2017: $8.40 (+5.79%)\n\n2018: $10.35 (+23.21%)\n\n2019:  $9.61 (-7.15%)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2015 - 2019 Change: +3.56%\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen if we use each 2019 EPS to calculate the P/E based on todays closing price of $452.04\n\n**P/E TTM as is:** $37.76\n\n**P/E TTM adjusted based on consistent shares outstanding:** $47.04\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNot really sure if I am even allowed to make an adjusted calculation based on what if they never brought back the shares but nonetheless here it is ....\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Point 3:**\n\nThis is purely speculation which is against the rules, I know .... but I can't help but think consumer psychology has to play a role in the market.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that consumers don't really know what they want until it is presented to them, iPhone has dominated the market for what seems like forever but in actuality, it has really only been about a decade. iPhone 4 was the real game changer since it allowed people to get their hands on an iPhone for other carriers. There seems to be a general consensus among many consumers now though that all Apple does is slap a new camera on each new model, repackage it, and put it on the shelf .... being in tech myself, I understand that the technical upgrades such as chipsets and other components that don't bring forth clear, tangible improvements do play a vital role in allowing the device to move forward and become more capable but I don't think the average consumer understands that.\n\nApple vs Android is a tired and pretty much done battle, they have been battling for the market for a while and many consumers have chosen their side and will likely stick with it at this point when comparing the 2 ... however, I have a feeling that if a new product were to emerge onto the market that were neither android or apple but introduced something reliable, new, and fresh then consumers would be more than ready for a change. Apple's double edged sword is that it is a complete ecosystem, all of the devices rely on some type of proprietary operating system which when paired together create a pretty good user experience between the devices. However, make no mistake, iPhone sits at the top of that ecosystem and for many consumers, iPhone is the segway into the Apple ecosystem. You get an iPhone and you like it .... so now when you get a computer you want a Mac etc. I say this to point out how financially dependent Apple is on the iPhone, if ever it should fail ... then the performance of the company will suffer miserably. How long can iPhone continue to dominate? Touch screen phones of this type have been running the scene for the past decade, I honestly think a major change is on the horizon for smart phones, but I don't necessarily believe Apple will be the company to usher it in .... and because of that belief I just don't think it would be a good idea to overpay for a stock now with the stupid belief that the what goes up must continue to go up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFrom everything I see it seems like Apple is severely overvalued right now, the company  has shown a long history of growth and one would like to think that would continue but based on the financials it doesn't seem like the growth factor is really there right now. I don't think the company is doomed or is a bad pick, I just don't think it's a good pick at its current price. However, with that being said ... I don't have nearly as much experience as many of you I'm sure and definitely not those analysts. on Wall Street, so I was trying to figure out why people are so excited as the price sits now and why the buy rating seems to be so high.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclosure, I have no position.

            "title": "Hi I made a very free and very large guide on investing using YouTube video and book recommendations with beginner / intermediate / advanced skill level tiers that I believe will set anyone up for investing success in the long term. Check it out and please lmk what you think!",
            "text": "**Investing guide**\n\n**Preface: Why I made this** \n\nLet’s start this guide off with an honest truth: I spend an unhealthy amount of time on Youtube. Whether it’s watching Japanese sumo championships, video games I don’t even play, or Mike Tyson absolutely annihilating anyone unlucky enough to box him: I love it all. Thankfully, some of my time has been put to good use. Over the past several years I have learned nearly everything I know about investing, almost exclusively through the platform, and that has changed my life. I have been investing in ETFs for the past 5 years, picking individual stocks for 2, and as of today (June 10, 2020) my portfolio is up over 60% overall. Investing, to me, is the path to financial freedom. The key to spending my life the way I desire and never needing to worry about money or slaving away at a job I don’t enjoy. \n\nI’ve been interested in investing since high school but I only just started recently because I had no clue where to begin, and entering the investing world intimidated the hell out of me. The education system provided me next to nothing in terms of personal finance, and anyone actually talking about it seemed like some sleaze bag that wanted to sell me something.\n\nI made this guide for anyone feeling that exact same way: I decided to slog through all the books and the hundreds of investment videos I have watched over the years to make a structured list of videos and personal notes that will give anyone, completely for free, the tools they need to begin investing and to succeed in creating wealth over the long term. \n\n**Disclaimer:** \n\nGetting through this guide will not be easy. At times it will suck, it will be boring, and it will be wildly time consuming. I have included many hours of videos and I expect you to watch each one. I want to be clear: If you cannot sit through a 45 minute video on how to learn to invest, then I would seriously reconsider investing at all. Patience is just as key in the markets as it is in learning new skills. \n\nI encourage you to use this guide as an education tool, but not as the definitive answer for how to invest. It is undoubtedly prone to my personal bias and my style of investing, which may or may not not fit your own. Nothing in the investment world is gospel and it is imperative to develop your own strategies, to stay humble, and to continue educating yourself.\n\nHowever, I do believe this guide should provide you with everything you need to begin investing and to be successful in the long term. Most, but not all, of the links provided reflect my own personal investment style, but occasionally I will present several different ideas and allow you to decide what is best for your own portfolio. Almost all of the linked videos are by amazing Youtubers that have tons of additional content, each of them with their own strategies, opinions, and expertise. Check them out. \n\nIf you decide you are ready to begin investing I have included my three brokerage recommendations at the bottom of the guide. Good luck!\n\n**Why should you invest?**\n\n[Why Investing is the Best Way to Get Rich | Phil Town](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOVamLc5Etc) - \n\nEssential video\n\n[Fresh Prince - If we so rich....](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS5jqXWECbI) \\-\n\nUncle Phil explaining the worry free life investing can provide\n\n**Beginner** \n\n[William Ackman: Everything You Need to Know About Finance and Investing in Under an Hour | Big Think](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEDIj9JBTC8)  \\- \n\nThis is a great overview of investing and finance taught by Bill Ackman, who recently made the most successful trade of all time: turning 27 million into 2.6 billion dollars.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRY9gEuoWLA&amp;list=WL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRY9gEuoWLA&amp;list=WL) \\- \n\nBroad beginner level investing video - what stocks are, where to buy them, how the buying process works, what brokerages to use, and strategies for protecting your money.

Covid has taught us that it is IMPERATIVE for a company to have cash on hand that can cover its short term debt obligations for a bare minimum of 1 quarter with no income. Some concepts in this video are pretty advanced, what I recommend is to —at least— know how much cash the company currently has on hand in comparison to their current debt. This can be done on yahoo finance by looking at the company's balance sheet.\n\nIf the company has significantly more debt than cash on hand then you need to figure out how much of that debt is short term (due within the next 12 months). If their cash on hand cannot cover that debt, then this company is an extremely risky investment. If this company is forced to shut down for any reason and cannot gain profitable revenue then in-order to avoid bankruptcy they will be required to take out more debt (which will be lent at extremely unfavorable rates) or to issue more shares to avoid bankruptcy. This issuance will dilute the share count and hurt current investors, also the issued shares will be sold at current market price which is likely to be a very low price for the company. \n\nBankruptcy totally wipes out the investor and your stock position will go to 0 as the company sells off its assets to pay off bond investors. If the company's assets value are above what they owe to bond holders then the remaining value will be distributed to shareholders. \n\n[The Cost of Share Dilution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHAM0VSkqQg) \\- \n\nShare dilution explained\n\n**Should I invest now or wait?**\n\n[A WARNING for ALL Investors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhYZU5uXmf4) \\- \n\nTime in the market beats timing the market\n\n[The Best Investing Advice of 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKmJNvSvmKw) \\- \n\nSame concept - you cannot time the market \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqqfltv\\_cSI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=40&amp;t=0s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqqfltv_cSI&amp;list=WL&amp;index=40&amp;t=0s) \\- \n\nExamination of the global economy using manufacturing numbers to consider the possibility of market recovery / another crash\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g32q6e3KZ5c&amp;t=320s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g32q6e3KZ5c&amp;t=320s) \\- \n\nPresents the idea that holding dividend paying stocks and companies that continue to grow is more powerful than holding a cash position \n\n[Waiting to Invest is Costing You...

D. Ameritrade -** \n\nA more professional broker than Robinhood with high level tools, graphs, apps, analysis, etc to use. However the layout is much more complicated and difficult to understand. It is pretty essential to use a professional platform like this if you are short-term trading as their price action is much more accurate than Robinhood. \n\n**Wealthfront -**  \n\nThis is a robo-advisor that builds a custom portfolio depending on your long term financial outlook and overall risk tolerance. The portfolio it builds is extremely diversified and managed by high level algorithms to insure your portfolio is properly balanced and not vulnerable to excess tax loss on realized gains. First 5000 managed for no fees. I love Wealthfront and the instant, diverse portfolio that they provide which requires 0 work or attention from you personally - my portfolio with them is around 4 years old and currently up 40%. \n\nUsing my link will give us both an additional 5000 dollars managed for no fees, and again, I would really appreciate it. \n\n\\- redacted for post rules -\n\n**DISCLAIMER**\n\nAll information and data within this guide are solely for informational purposes.

We continue to expand our data center capacity in line with both near-term and long-term demand signals. We have more than doubled our overall data center capacity in the last three years. And we have added more capacity last year than any other year in our history.\"\n* **AMZN**: Generative AI is a “really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity,” - Amazon CEO Andy Jassy to analyst during ER [call.In](http://call.In) same ER call: “Our deep collaboration with NVIDIA goes back more than 13 years, when we launched the world’s first GPU cloud instance on AWS. Today we offer the widest range of GPU solutions available anywhere in the cloud, supporting the world’s most technologically advanced accelerated workloads. It's why the new NVIDIA Blackwell GPU will run so well on AWS and the reason that NVIDIA chose AWS to co-develop Project Ceiba, combining NVIDIA’s next-generation Grace Blackwell Superchips with the AWS Nitro System's advanced virtualization and ultra-fast Elastic Fabric Adapter networking, for NVIDIA's own AI research and development. Through this joint effort between AWS and NVIDIA engineers, we're continuing to innovate together to make AWS the best place for anyone to run NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud.” *Will skip 'The Jevons paradox' that Jassy shared during the ER call signaling increased AI work and adoption, since everyone must be bored to death by this theory. Also, trying to avoid using emotions or wishful thinking in this research thesis.*\n* **NVDA**:  **Jensen Huang**, Stanford Conference, 2024 (pre-deepseek or anything remotely similar. How aware he was of events like Deepseek much before it happened, and how he envisions NVDA will keep growing even more as a result of such software improvements)\n   * ***Question***: \"According to your projection and calculation in 5 to 10 years how much more semiconductor manufacturing capacity is needed to support the growth of AI\"\n   * ***Answer***: \"We're going to need more Fabs however remember that we're also **improving the (software) algorithms and the processing of it um tremendously over time** it's **not as if the efficiency of computing will be what it is today** and therefore the demand is this much in the meantime I'm **improving Computing by a million times every 10 years** while **demand is going up by a trillion times** and that has to offset each other does that make sense and then there's technology diffusion and so on so forth that's just a matter of time but it doesn't change the fact that one day all of the computers in the world will be changed 100% every single data center will be all of those general purpose Computing data centers 100% of the trillion dollars worth of infrastructure will be completely changed and then there'll be new infrastructure built on even on top of that\"\n   * ***Question***: You make completely State of-the-art chips. Is it possible though, that you'll face competition, that claims to be good enough, not as good as Nvidia, but good enough, and and much cheaper is that a threat. *See highlighted/bolded section if you don't want to read the long answer*\n   * ***Answer***:*TL;DR*: **our TCO (Total Cost of Operations to the AI customer) is so good that even when the competitor's chips are free, it's not cheap enough.**\"We have more competition than anyone on the planet has competition. Not only do we have competition from competitors, we have competition from our customers, and I'm the only competitor to a customer fully knowing they're about to design a chip to replace ours, and I show them not only what my current chip is, I show them what my next chip is, and I'll show them what my chip after that is.And the reason for that is because, look, if you don't make an attempt at explaining why you're good at something, they'll never get a chance to buy your products. And so, we're completely open book in working with just about everybody in the industry.And the reason for that—our advantage—is several. What we're about is several things. Whereas you could build a chip to be good at one particular algorithm, remember, computing is more than even Transformers. There's this idea called Transformers; there's a whole bunch of species of Transformers, and there are new Transformers being invented as we speak. And the number of different types of software is really quite rich.And so, we can accelerate that. We can accelerate quantum physics. We can accelerate Schrödinger's equations. We can accelerate just about everything—fluids, particles, lots and lots of code.And so, what NVIDIA is good at is the general field of accelerated computing. One of them is generative AI. And so, for a data center that wants to have a lot of customers—some in financial services, some in manufacturing, and so on—in the world of computing, we're a great standard. We're in every single cloud, we're in every single computer company, and so our company's architecture has become a standard, if you will, after some 30-some years. And so, that's really our advantage.If a customer can do something specifically that's more cost-effective, quite frankly, I'm even surprised by that. And the reason for that is this: Remember, our chip is only part of it. Think of when you see computers these days—it's not a computer like a laptop. It's a computer, it's a data center, and you have to operate it. And so, people who buy and sell chips think about the price of chips. People who operate data centers think about **the cost of operations (TCO)**—our *time to deployment, our performance, our utilization, our flexibility across all these different applications in total* allows our operations cost—they call it total cost of operations, TCO—**our TCO is so good that even when the competitor's chips are free, it's not cheap enough**. And that is our goal—to add so much value that the alternative is not about cost. And so, of course, that takes a lot of hard work, and we have to keep innovating and things like that, and we don't take anything for granted. But we have a lot of competitors.\"\n* **Perplexity AI CEO**: [https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1889668709356023942](https://x.com/AravSrinivas/status/1889668709356023942) \"Need to clarify this in no ambiguous terms: We still think **NVIDIA is peerless and singular and the industry leader by far. And nothing changes in our relationship with them**. I like Andrew and Cerebras team and they have really done good work in helping us achieve the 1200 tok/sec. It’s primarily the quality of our post training and the value of the data we have collected as a product that’s serving so many millions of users that got us to be better than the lightweight OpenAI and Anthropic models and on-par with the bigger ones. **All this was done on NVIDIA GPUs**. We benefitted a lot from Llama 3.3 that was trained with a ton of NVIDIA GPUs. We still **serve majority of the models we serve on production on NVIDIA GPUs**, eg custom versions of Llama and DeepSeek R1. **Cerebras or Grok are not robust chips** that can handle both dense models and sparse MoEs yet. NVIDIA chips can do any model class really efficiently. Cerebras is still bound by capacity constraints. I wish the Cerebras team and Andrew the best and glad we’re working with them and I think competition is good for the industry and will push NVIDIA to innovate faster on Blackwell and next generation of chips. But, *I do not appreciate any clickbait PR that claims Perplexity is moving away from NVIDIA or NVIDIA moats are disappearing*. We did not participate in that PR ourselves.\"\n\n**On DeepSeek:**  \nThe viral blog was authored by Jeffrey Emanuel (BA, Reed College, 2005), who does not hail from an AI background (academic or industrial), and does not have experience at a top-firm of their field (buy-side, or sell-side, or IB). So, the infamous blog which caused a flash crash of 600B in a day, may not be well founded and may feel sloppy to say the least. Prior AI investment experience does not necessarily evoke sound understanding to identify bloated claims from research papers. All it created was a stampede in a crowded theatre of people who wanted to be the first one out of the stampede, and are too scared to go back in, after it was found to be a hoax. The Chain-of-Thought concept explored in the paper is not new, and has been there for quite a few years. The paper took a departure from regular fine-tuning and relied on CoT processes which produces more grounded responses. The total cost of creating the model was grossly understated, and the results released in their paper was selectively shared, while it underperforms on few non-reported metrics.The AI research community needs just the very best GPUs to carry out their experiments, serving models via inference is just one aspect where people may even try to customize their specialized chips  (see Jensen's response in earlier point), but the superpower of NVDA chips is how far ahead they are for the competition to even catch up, that AMD CEO famously stated that NVDA chips are so far ahead, that they chose to not compete with NVDA in creating the best chips - someone can link the news piece, if they have it readily available.\n\n**On Need for more compute**:  \nWhile it may be noted that GenAI is mostly task-based, and not AGI, a challenge most researchers are figuring out rather than beating another state-of-the-art performance on yet another curated dataset.  \n**The most understated aspect is that model developers need the most state-of-the-art devices so as to not be constrained in their experiments and prefer general purpose devices for experiments to create breakthroughs. There will always be firms playing catchups and creating optimization, while industry leaders will strive to stay ahead as opposed to becoming an IBM, who stayed stuck in the older era of computing.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vigya6z9auie1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=76763f0e9207efe71cda164b303dda0cb0241312\n\n**NVDA GPU backlogs**:  \nThe GPU orders are so backlogged, that prompted the AMZN CEO Andy Jassy to mention his investment in proprietary chips, to let users have a choice of cheaper chips, despite them not being the very best (see earlier section on his ER comments for added context): \"customers that they want better price performance on their AI workloads. As customers approach higher scale in their implementations, they realize quickly that AI can get costly. It's why we've invested in our own custom silicon in Trainium for training and Inferentia for inference. The second version of Trainium, Trainium2 is starting to ramp up in the next few weeks and will be very compelling for customers on price performance.\"  \nAlso refer to other chipmakers like AVGO and Cerebras. *Counter*: See the earlier point made by Perplexity CEO.\n\nWhile there will always be competitors as Jensen stated in section 3, they are well aware of their moat, and while there is always another social media app competing with Facebook (META), there is always a leader, and leads to better products and aggressive growth, rather then devolving into an IBM. As an example, one would strive to hire a top scientist from a top-school, as opposed to hire a person self-taught in their basement and using their local-resources. As always, exceptions exist.\n\n**Moat** (outside of the earlier point on competition note by Jensen):  \nThis segment is over and above NVDA CEO Jensen's (pre Deepseek) and Perplexity's comments (post Deepseek). Keeping this additional segment short, and invite readers to read up further on it, since it is more technical than the rest of the thesis.I have been using CUDA since 2013, which many *current GenAI experts (recently-minted from deepseek fiasco)* may not have had a chance to explore. Some of their other propietary technologies are CUDA, nCCL, cuDNN, TesorRT, NVLink, MIG, OptiX, DOCA (Data Center-on-a-Chip Architecture).AMD &amp; Intel don’t have a CUDA alternative (ROCm is underdeveloped, and Intel's OneAPI is not competitive). NVIDIA’s ecosystem (CUDA + TensorRT + hardware) is an end-to-end solution that competitors lack.\n\n**Quantum**:  \nThey have been invested in Quantum technologies, and are hosting the upcoming\"***NVIDIA GTC 2025: Quantum Day to Illuminate the Future of Quantum Computing***\" [https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gtc-2025-quantum-day/](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gtc-2025-quantum-day/), March 17-21, 2025: \"At the first-of-its-kind event, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang will host industry leaders to discuss where quantum computing is headed\".\n\nWhile I can not comment on the ethicality of his recent quantum jab, but they have been very heavily invested in R&amp;D in this space.While Quantum has two main approaches (annealing, and gate-based), one of which is currently usable (annealing) and the other (gate-based) is currently experimental. NVDA may have recognized this and I suspect his comment was aimed at the gate-based quantum approach.\n\n**Conclusion**:  \nI need to go to sleep, so have to call it a day and wrap it up, although there are some additions on how the fear generated by a half-baked viral blog by Emanuel Jeffrey, that may have been necessary, but nevertheless was unfounded. It is understandable, since the AI revolution may be seen as having three facets: a) the model creators, b) model use-case creators, and c) AI users. From my understanding of people, the people in the model-creators segment are not necessarily very vocal, except in research efforts and publications, and not as visible in the wall-street or media. As always, exceptions exist.\n\n**Not Financial Advice** (NFA) - do your own DD, and evaluate your risk tolerance.\n\n**My Position**: Expecting PT 162/stock post-earnings on 2/26.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lpdwm95m7uie1.png?width=1248&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2feb1d06345b551e5faf0bb837493e46897e4cd7",

            "title": "A Deep Dive on PayPal: Is it a good time to Buy? [DD]",
            "text": "A couple of years ago, PayPal was all the hype. Today, the stock is down 75% from its all-time high. Once a growth stock, PayPal is now moving towards value stock territory. The big question here is this. Is PayPal worth buying right now? Is it a bargain or is it a value trap?\n\n# Operations\n\nFirst of all, let's look at PayPal's operations. PayPal's main source of revenue are the fees that PayPal charges for completing transactions and other payment-related services. Other revenue sources include foreign currency conversion fees and also fees for purchasing or selling cryptocurrencies. As such, PayPal's business model is based on the volume of transactions. The more transactions, the more fees the company gets. In 2022, users, transactions and payment volume on PayPal increased.\n\n* 2% increase in users to 435 million with 8.6 million new net accounts addedOut of these, 400 million were consumer active accounts and 35 million were active merchant accounts\n* 16% increase in number of transactions to 22.3 billion\n* 9% total payment volume increase to $1.36 trillion on a spot basis so basically without adjusting for any forex changes.\n\nThe family of PayPal brands includes Braintree, Chargehound, Honey, Venmo and others so the company has a very strong brand presence. I keep seeing an ad for Honey almost every single day, I think the other brands are more US-focused (I'm UK-based), but the gist of it is that PayPal is becoming more popular, more established. [Recently, PayPal added more features to its payment solutions for small businesses.](https://investor.pypl.com/news-and-events/news-details/2023/PayPal-Adds-New-Features-to-Its-Complete-Payments-Solution-for-Online-Small-Businesses/default.aspx) The main change was increasing the range of payment options for customers by including Apple Pay along with saving payment options and others.\n\n# Competition\n\nWhen it comes to mobile payments, PayPal competes with the likes of Google Pay, Cash App, Zelle, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Venmo although Venmo is actually owned by PayPal. They all have some pros and cons. However, PayPal appears to have the best international payment support. PayPal owns Xoom which allows users to send payments to users in 131 countries without the recipient needing an app or a smartphone. The recipient can just pick up the payment at their local bank. PayPal also allows you to send money to people in over 200 countries worldwide as long as they also have the app. PayPal is also ahead of the competition when it comes to web and website payments since you can complete the payment by using any web browser. Doesn't matter if it's Firefox, Chrome or Safari. However, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Google Pay can be used with smart watches which are becoming more and more popular.\n\n***US market***  \nIn fact, this may be one of the reasons why Apple Pay is the most widely used mobile payment service in the US. 43.9 million people report using it at least once followed by Starbucks with 31.2 million. Yes, Starbucks, I know, I'm surprised as well, but it seems to be a popular method of payment in the US. Google Pay follows with 25 million users and Samsung Pay with 16.3 million users. Again, this is in the US.\n\n***Worldwide***  \nIn terms of total mobile payment users worldwide, you have AliPay and WeChat Pay with 650 and 500 million users respectively, followed by Apple Pay with 507 million, Google Pay with 421 million and PayPal with 377 million. Venmo has 52 million, but it counted separately. If you combine the two since Paypal owns Venmo, Paypal comes ahead of Google Pay with 429 million users. Plus, AliPay and WeChat Pay are pretty much the status quo in China, but they are not that big outside of China. In fact, I'm not sure you can get them outside of China unless you are a Chinese national. Essentially, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Paypal are the big international names. Now, Google and Apple have a big advantage because they obviously produce their own phones, they have iOS and Android and they pretty much come with built-in Apple and Google Pay. They also have the smart watches which integrate with these payment apps.\n\n***Total Payment Volume competition***  \nNow, it would be really good if we could see the official total payment volume through these apps and compare it with Paypal. It could be the case where because the payment apps are installed by default, it seems they have a large userbase, but in reality users don't use them as much as Paypal or they just use them for small purchases. [The closest stats I could find were in this article here](https://www.paymentsjournal.com/apple-pay-transaction-volume-news-creates-mixed-messaging/). The author claims that Apple Pay has a total transaction volume of $6 trillion whereas Google Pay had $2.5 trillion. However, these are not official statistics by either of these companies. There are also disagreements over what exactly constitutes an Apple Pay or Google Pay transaction. In most cases, people don't pay with the apps, they just use the wallet option to pay with their actual card instead of paying with the digital payment app. Again, we don't know the exact transaction volume and we can just speculate, but we can see why Apple and Google Pay are massive competitors to Paypal. Still, the good thing is that the market for mobile payment apps is growing fast worldwide. There are a lot more users left to capture and Paypal is in a good position to do that as one of the leading payment apps, but enough about operations.\n\n# Financials metrics\n\nWe know Paypal is big and we know it's not going anywhere. The company is a viable competitor to Google and Apple, but what are the financials of Paypal? Are they profitable? Are they efficient? What's the case here?\n\nTo answer these questions, I will look at Paypal's current and historical metrics and compare them to the company's peers in the Transaction and Payment Processing sector in the US. Quick note on the sector metrics. This sector is dominated by Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Fiserv, Block and Fidelity National Information Services. These 6 companies make up 77% of the total revenue in this sector. Meanwhile, 18 of the 35 companies in the sector are losing money. Basically, take the sector data with some hint of salt. I want to provide some comparison for Paypal, but at the same time we have a duopoly of Visa and Mastercard at the top and a lot of new players at the bottom.\n\nOkay, so lets look at profitability. Paypal has a:\n\n* gross profit margin of 42.35% which is below its 5-year average of 45.79% and the sector median of 47.32%\n* net income margin of 8.79% is also below its 5-year average of 14.58%, but above the sector median of 0.57%\n* levered free cash flow margin stands at 12.1% compared to its 5-year average of 14.58% and the sector median of 4.73%\n* Return on Equity is decent at 11.5% compared to the 5-year average of 16.7% and the sector median of 11.05%\n\nOverall, Paypal is doing well. Their metrics have declined over the last few years which is worrying, but the change has not been that drastic \\[yet\\]. It's good to monitor these metrics of course because this could turn into a red flag if the trend continues.\n\n# Analyst Expectations\n\nDespite the above, analysts are expecting a steady growth in earnings per share over the next few years. The consensus is:\n\n* 18.33% in 2023\n* 15.28% in 2024\n* 13.07% in 2025\n\nIn fact, analysts have recently started revising their expectations up which is a good sign. Basically, the sentiment towards Paypal is improving after a year and a half of declining expectations. This type of expectations change often leads to a reversal in stock price so this is one reason why I am turning bullish on Paypal.\n\nPaypal has historically shown really good growth in revenue and earnings. Their compounded annual revenue growth is 17% since 2013 with their revenue going from $6,727 billion in 2013 to $27,518 billion in 2022. Their compounded annual earnings growth is 10.9% with earnings growing from $955 million in 2013 to $2.42 billion in 2022. By the looks of it, this type of growth can be sustained for at least another few years.\n\n# Valuation\n\nThis is really, really good, mainly because the stock has lately been priced as a value stock. Paypal has:\n\n* adjusted PE ratio of 18.15 compared to the 5-year average of 41.72.\n* adjusted forward PE ratio of 15.34 compared to the 5-year average of 37.94\n* price-to-earnings growth ratio of only 1.1 compared to the 5-year average of 2\n* relatively low forward price-to-book of 3.74 compared to the 5-year average of 8.1\n* forward price-to-cash-flow of 11.84 compared to their 5-year average of 27.4\n\nThe way I see it, there are 2 reasons for the low valuation.\n\nOne, Paypal had a massively inflated stock price in 2021. Typically, you see a corresponding massive drop in price after this type of jump in valuation. Overreaction in one direction leads to overreaction in the opposite direction, a bit like a pendulum. This creates an amazing buying opportunity and I think we are seeing this right now.\n\nThe second reason for the low valuation could be that investors have different expectations to analysts. Even though the analysts expect a steady growth in earnings and profits, maybe investors don't see it that that way. Maybe there are some risk factors that analysts are overlooking. That's valid. Looking at Paypal's annual report, we can see a lot of factors that the company identifies. Cybersecurity is a crucial one, increasing competition is another. You also have legislation and compliance risk, you have risk to do with credit, third parties and so on. A lot of these are just regular day-to-day business threats that a financial processing company faces.\n\nThe main risk in my eyes is the increasing competition from Google and Apple. However, Paypal has some advantage there because it is mainly a financial company. Google and Apple have other more important business units and I think that Google Pay and Apple Pay are not as important to these companies as their core businesses. In comparison, payments and transactions are Paypal's core business. Cryptocurrency is also a growing risk, but I don't think it poses that big of a threat to Paypal right now. Maybe in 5 years or so. However, Paypal has been active in allowing users to buy, sell and transfer cryptocurrencies. Plus, users can actually use Paypal to pay in crypto although there are improvements that can be made there.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nOverall, I think that **we currently have a good bullish argument for Paypal**. The valuation is really cheap. We are seeing some of the lowest prices since December 2018. Even the company itself has committed to buying back a lot of shares because of the cheap price. In 2022, Paypal bought back $4.2 billion worth of shares or about 80% of their free cash flow. The management has said that they think share buybacks are an excellent way to spend their capital and I agree. They estimate that 75% of the free cash flow in 2023 will go towards share repurchases. In my opinion, this will create bullish pressure for the company. It will reduce the floating stock, it will increase ownership for existing shareholders and it will boost metrics. In terms of target price, the analyst consensus right now is $103.4 dollars or about a 38% upside on the current price of $75. I think that's a reasonable target for the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nWhat do you think? Is Paypal a good purchase right now? Have I missed any important details about their business?",

            "title": "Follow-Up Post on Earnings Day: $IONQ Set for a Massive Rally with Multiple Catalysts Ahead",
            "text": "**TL;DR:** Still long $IONQ on earnings day and not planning to sell anytime soon. Nothing in this post is financial advice, as I consistently lose money.  \n  \n**Ticker:** $IONQ  \n**Industry:** Computer Hardware  \n**Current Price:** $16.35\n\nA month ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g3rx6h/ionq_will_experience_a_massive_rally_and_has/) about IonQ, and since then, the stock has rallied from $10 to $16. Today, the company is holding its earnings call after hours, and I expect a positive reaction in the stock price, followed by consolidation before a potential higher move later this year. Coined as the Nickelback of DD, I made a few nickels on this trade.\n\nI won’t dive into the tech behind quantum or why it’s game-changing, but from an investment perspective, the time to position is now (though ideally, it was 6 months ago). I believe FOMO is about to kick in.\n\nAll the technical slides and key info are publicly available on IonQ’s investor website, PowerPoints, corporate presentations, and interviews with management over the years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lj4rzyh0bzd1.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=895a8e6b55df96f34886886d734f8659b9472f57\n\n# Sources I recommend:\n\n* Shawn Kwon: A Korean YouTuber who traveled to the States to [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YldqcQ35NlQ) IonQ’s management. He recently posted an insightful [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OezQl80rloU) with them.\n* Peter Chapman: IonQ’s CEO has had some interviews that are really hyping me up. In a [recent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSVRPDrI8aI) one, he discusses how quantum is gaining commercial traction, especially due to having the right product at the right time, solving AI's growing energy needs.\n* Forbes Interview on Quantum AI: Forbes recently [covered](https://www.forbes.com/sites/torconstantino/2024/10/02/is-quantum-computing-an-unlikely-answer-to-ais-looming-energy-crisis/) the role of quantum AI in addressing AI's energy demands, with IonQ revealing that they're launching a quantum-AI chip prototype in the coming months aimed at reducing power consumption.\n* IonQ's Technical Roadmap: IonQ is ahead by 1 year on its ambitious [roadmap](https://ionq.com/resources/ionq-technology-and-performance-updates-milestones-commercial-advantage?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Q2-2024-webinar&amp;utm_content=webinar&amp;utm_term=45474) and consistently overdelivers, which gives me even more confidence in their future progress.\n\n# Revenue Growth and Business Progress\n\nAfter all, this is what we’re all here for. IonQ has consistently grown its revenue quarter over quarter. I heard Chapman mention that Q3 and Q4 are expected to be their strongest quarters, so I’m expecting a double beat today as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5wcagdfyxazd1.png?width=1979&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb8b94b8151b001a4926163c7c79e7b1d6f5ea55\n\nThis is their roadmap based on the qubits they plan to achieve. They’ve mentioned that they expect to gain a commercial advantage starting in 2026, but after today, good results could lead to forward pricing.\n\nQubits, like bits in classical computers, determine the computational power of quantum computers. In quantum computing, qubits scale exponentially in potential, as each additional qubit doubles the system's computational capacity. This is because a quantum system with multiple qubits can represent a superposition of all possible combinations of the qubit states, making quantum systems exponentially more powerful with each added qubit.\n\nBottom line: For a more powerful system, revenue is expected to scale exponentially as well, unlocking more applications that were previously unattainable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/blkjixeayazd1.png?width=1440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fcc97293e73bded17a2447ba82232142133eca0\n\nJust two days ago, their latest [system](https://status.ionq.co/), **Forte**, became accessible on their cloud. This will likely drive more revenue, as anyone can now test their systems through IonQ’s cloud or other major cloud providers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrla5dymzazd1.png?width=916&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d75c3e90390ded079954b4eb76be0ba50484289\n\nWith hyperscalers now planning to literally build nuclear reactors to power their data centers, I believe this is the perfect moment to introduce a new kind of computing product to the market. All made in the USA.\n\n# Business Applications\n\nI’ve heard a lot of people say that applications are at least 10 years away, and value creation will take 10-15 years. But I disagree with that perspective.\n\nThis is their landing page on quantum [applications](https://ionq.com/applications-services), and it looks solid. They’re focusing on areas that Nvidia is also targeting right now: digital twins, hybrid computing, and machine learning. Many of their staff come from top companies like Nvidia, Amazon, and Dell.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/asslamcuuazd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a18728c7dbfa500838c003f7e6fe1ec449d02abe\n\nRecently, they’ve posted some interesting job openings: one for **Quantum AI** and the other for **Quantum Applications Chemistry**, both for scientist positions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plbtkkamtazd1.png?width=917&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=78a67ea32c71e9e122de2f29c3ad126ccba93f78\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/syiuz5ertazd1.png?width=901&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b26d7531a88554803c333a0f28f51fcfca52cf1\n\nIt seems like they’re ready to develop apps for customers right away. As mentioned in the previous post, **today** they will showcase their first application, presumably focused on the healthcare industry. Personally, I think it will be related to pharma, especially since they’ve partnered with Quantum Basel in Switzerland to provide quantum access to nearby organizations.\n\nThe good thing is that after today, investors will immediately know whether this showcased app is something of value or not. We’ll find out if it’s commercially viable and applicable to the industry or just a prototype far from commercialization. Either way, it's better to clarify this quickly.\n\n# Options Chain\n\nI’m sharing this to highlight that institutions are taking an interest, not to promote options gambling. In recent months, IonQ’s chain has shifted from being sh\\*tty to balanced. This is the chain for the 2026 LEAPS. The OTM $35 strikes have attracted significant attention over the past few weeks, going from no open interest to 3k contracts for a $3B company since late summer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ln9ryu8duazd1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0da88dfcb6c3b7d26615e06abf5dc9d97c59973\n\n# Institutional and Government Interest\n\nIn a recent interview on [CNBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78JiA4ealks), Amy Raslin discussed why her fund went long on IonQ. This decision came after the stock rallied from $10 to $14 just a week ago.\n\nAdditionally, Congressman Glenn Ivey [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E27cYheKQHE) with Bloomberg and Peter Chapman about the growing support for IonQ.\n\n# Competitors\n\nFor those saying that Dell or Microsoft are leading the way in quantum hardware, they don’t know what they’re talking about.\n\nIonQ has the highest gate fidelity and error correction in the industry, along with the largest contracts from government institutions like ARLIS. The White House has even highlighted IonQ’s efforts to scale up their manufacturing facility in Bothell as part of their \"[Investing in America](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Washington-IIA-State-Fact-Sheet.pdf)\" agenda.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhb8fjh7wazd1.png?width=988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fd8a2eff6f5f04780723c99178ebc67d3ba404d0\n\n# Bear Thesis\n\nThe bear thesis, largely pushed by day traders these days, focuses on technical analysis charts and claims that IonQ is overbought. A few years ago, Scorpion Capital published a short report, which was promptly [responded](https://ionq.com/posts/may-12-2022-ionq-founders-respond) to by the founders. Since then, no large short positions have emerged with a solid thesis against IonQ. It's a bet against the technology and IonQ's ability to commercialize it.\n\nBears often argue that IonQ is expensive based on valuation metrics and negative EPS. This argument makes no sense since they’re just starting out and went public before generating revenue.\n\nBut this is exactly the moment to make a decision in my opinion: do you believe IonQ will continue to execute its roadmap? If so, do you enter now, before the revenue starts to come in and the price catches up to projections, or do you wait until the stock is trading at higher multiples but miss the current $16 entry point?\n\nI think that a lot of the bearish articles are laughable, especially when they keep repeating that quantum is \"10 years away.\" Beyond timing and valuation, no other real bear arguments seem to make it into the debate.\n\n# Founders\n\nI’ve seen some people argue that the founders leaving IonQ to continue their research signals that the ship is sinking and is an obvious short sell. However, the reality is that the founders didn't leave because the company is failing; they transitioned to focus on their academic work after 20 years of research. The company is now in the hands of a commercial and specialized quantum team focused on scaling up the commercialization efforts.\n\nIt all started 20 years ago in a lab in Maryland, when an investor approached the founders after reading their paper in a journal. That investor proposed creating a company based on their groundbreaking technology, and here we are today.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThat said, the run on the stock is far from over. It will last for years, with investors cashing out at various price levels along the way. I have no idea what will be said during earnings or what we can expect from the application that is to be showcased, but I’m eagerly waiting to find out.",

            "title": "Twilio Financials and Underlying Story",
            "text": "Today I thought I would take a look at Twilio (TWLO), a company who's stock is up 6x since its IPO and what seem to be their drivers of value.\n\n**Industry**\nTwilio operates within the unified communications and communications platform as a service market, which allows companies to use Twilio to contact customers via Text, Voice, and email in an automated fashion. A use case in this, and one of Twilio's largest customers, is [WhatsApp](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2018/08/09/twilio-makes-whatsapp-available-inside-any-app/#5b4eb9db13b7) who uses Twilio to send automated text messages to verify customers on their platform. A similar example is with [Uber](https://customers.twilio.com/208/uber/). The overall market size for Twilio and its peers varies all over the place, with some showing as little as [$3.5B up to $32T](https://exponents.co/twilio-market-opportunities-risks/). One research report from Gartner show sthe unified communications marekt is [$40B](https://exponents.co/twilio-market-opportunities-risks/), with most of the growth occuring in cloud services rather than on-prem solutions. This fits in with Twilios recent acquisition of [SendGrid](https://s21.q4cdn.com/247074597/files/doc_presentations/2018/10/Twilio-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Sendgrid.pdf), which augments their programmable solutions for Voice, Video, and Messaging with email solutions as well.\n\n**Revenue**\n\nIn their most recent quarter, Twilio states that they have 162k active customer accounts (active accounts that have generated &gt;$5/revenue in the last month). Given that their quarterly **Base Revenue** was approximately $257mm, that translates into a quarterly spend of $1,600/customer, or an annualized $6,300/customer. This number is a blended result of Twilio and SendGrid, which they closed their merger on February 1st of 2019. On a stand alone basis, Twilio earns ~ $11,600/customer/year, while SendGrid is earning $1,900/customer/year. Both companies have been steadily increasing [pricing per customer](https://imgur.com/a/qmH74mD), which on a combined basis is up [22% year-over-year](https://imgur.com/FEbfYwP). \n\nLooking forward, the company has given guidance of $276 - $278mm and $1,064 - $1,068mm of Base Revenue for Q3 and FY19, respectively. Two key metrics then factor in here. On a combined basis, revenue per customer has grown at a 3.4% CAGR and number of customers have grown at a 7.2% CAGR since 1Q16. Their guidance target fits well within these ranges.\n\n**Customer Value**\n\nOne minor diversion here that we can pull from Twilio's financials is their [customer lifetime value partly from slide 18](https://s21.q4cdn.com/247074597/files/doc_presentations/2017-Analyst-Day/7__finance.pdf). The gross contribution per customer has been increasing steadily from $2,150/year to $3,650/year. Given their Dollar Net Expansion Rate is &gt;140% (implying customers are spending 40% more than the same period 1 year ago), I am eschewing the [simplified model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value#Methodology) and using an [H-model](https://www.dividend.com/dividend-education/dividend-based-stock-valuation-the-h-dividend-discount-model/) to give credit for a near-term high growth rate and a long-term stable growth rate. Even with a relatively short high growth period, the value of each additional subscriber ([~$50k](https://imgur.com/Hl9kaCf)) greatly outweighs the meager $1,500 customer acquisition cost. Assuming $48k, net of subscriber acquisition cost, the value of their customer portfolio is worth [~$7.5 - 8.0B](https://imgur.com/QtQOwpB). \n\n**Costs**\n\nFrom a cost perspective, Twilio is fairly stable with Cost of sales being ~44%, Research and Development ~24%, and Sales and Marketing ~25% of Base Revenue. The bulk of their cost of sales is related to fees paid to cellular providers to pay for connection costs. Likely they will see some margin improvements across the board as they're able to centralize equipment and software between their platform and SendGrid (and whatever usual synergies are expected). One interesting note is that Twilio noted most of their growth will come from abroad, which will require additional employee and cost burdens as the company moves globally (the company only has 25% of its revenue internationally today). \n\n**Capitalization**\n\nTwilio has about [$22B](https://imgur.com/D14czea) of total capital in the company. The substantial bulk of the funds come from their outstanding equity ($21B) with the remaining $1B coming from a 0.25% Sr. convertible bond due 2023, which is convertible at $70.90/share. Given the company has been operating so far effectively as a breakeven business, the company has another 3+ years before needing to address the convertible bond, which will likely convert into equity. Additionally, the company is sitting on $1.9B of cash and marketable securities. \n\n**Returns**\n\nOverall the market has been very supportive of Twilio's strategy, with the stock up 32% YTD (through their Q2 reporting) and 160% year-over-year. This has led to a number of articles coming up that the company is overvalued. One way I've looked at it, is the invested capital as a multiple of the value of their customer portfolio. Around the time of their IPO, Twilio was valued at 2x their customer base (invested capital of $3.3B vs. $1.6B for customer portfolio). Today the company is around 2.5x. This does reflect that it is [an expensive time](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/10/04/is-twilio-stock-a-falling-knife-or-a-buying-opport.aspx) to get into the stock (particularly compared to 12/31/17 when it was 1x). Implicitly, the market must be placing a higher value on the growth opportunities in the business and what Twilio will be able to generate.\n\nTL;DR Twilio's recent acquisition of SendGrid gives the company the platform to be a truly unified communications company, providing email, voice, and text services to their customers. Investors expectation of combined growth has increased substantially, with a lot of opportunities to cross-sell between the platforms. Support [here](https://imgur.com/a/qmH74mD). Per usual, excel available upon request.\n\nExcel [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/yfd82e9t3n65hdt/TWLO.xlsx?dl=0)",

            "title": "Someone take a look at my DCF model? Feedback and some specific questions.",
            "text": "Hi there,\n\nAs the title says, I'm practicing making an operating model and valuation through DCF analysis on that. I was wondering if someone could review it and give me some thoughts about it. I also have a few specific questions. As of yet this is so far my best one I've done but there are still some problems I can't seem to solve. \n\nSo the company in question is Lululemon Athletica. I built the model from the 2015 and 2014 annual reports. I made the income statement first then made a framework for the cash flows, did the depreciation and working capital tables afterwards so I could input those onto cash flows and then applied the changes in CF to the balance sheet. \n\nDropbox:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/nfygl8hnqc7tkcy/LULU.xlsx?dl=0\n\nSo the following were some things I was wondering about. \n\n1. Are there any glaring issues in usability or accounting rules in my model?\n\nI've been reading two introductory books on building financial models, \"Building Financial Models\" by Tjia and \"Financial Modeling and Valuation\" by Pignataro.  \n\n2. I've found that Pignataro's method of building from cash flows first a lot more intuitive however Tjia argues for building the balance sheet first. Pignataro makes the argument that  doing the cash flows first makes the process more intuitive and less error prone but some reviewers of the book dislike this saying that it is in-fact more error prone and not standard procedure.  What are the pros and cons of the two approaches?\n\n3. Going from the second question, Tjia seems to stress pretty heavily about using plug accounts such as an \"excess cash\" or \"necessary to finance\" line to balance. I find this pretty sloppy as it tends to ignore the problem of balancing altogether. Could someone comment about this?\n\n4. For the future, how do you set up a cash flow statement? For this valuation, most of the accounts affected are pretty clear. However there were still a couple of items that I didn't know what to do with such as Sales Tax collected, Stock-based compensation and De-recognition of Gift Cards. Overall I decided to replace these and put into a simpler changes in account form. \n\n5. Could someone take a look at the balance sheet difference? I traced every account balance change back to the cash flow statement but I still couldn't find anything. It actually seems as though each cash flow statement record is present within the balance sheet and the difference is \"just there\" somehow. I didn't notice any double counting, but I'll be doing more checks after making this post as well.\n\nEdit: Fixed the balancing issue. As it turns out, the depreciation table generates a differed tax liability firstly, I did correctly count it as a non-cash expense but \"double counted\" by making putting what would be the liability into the differed tax assets. I didn't consider to multiply my balance sheet differences by two to see if there were any sign flip issues.",

            "title": "GEO Group and Underlying Financials",
            "text": "A week or so ago I posted a financial analysis of WeWork and found it so interesting I thought I would do another. If this becomes a routine, I'll choose these based on whatever is in the headlines recently. So there really is no science to selecting the companies.\n\nIn today's case, I thought it would be interesting to look into GEO Group, one of the largest for-profit private prison operators in the United States. I want to be absolutely clear at the start, there are many viewpoints on the industry and many of them are valid. I am going to side-step all the legal, moral, and/or ethical issues with the industry and only focus on the financial profile of the company. This is not to discount those concerns, but to acknowledge they are beyond my expertise and experience. So, without ado:\n\nGEO Group (or GEO) operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust that owns or manages 133 facilities with [97,000 beds](http://investors.geogroup.com/Cache/1500123743.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500123743&amp;iid=4144107). Beyond the U.S., they also operate facilities in the [UK, Australia, and South Africa](https://imgur.com/KBGwZ1R). Of the 133 facilities, 78 are owned outright by GEO, 20 are leased, and 35 are only managed (meaning, they provide all the services but the building). To quote from their Annual report \"We operate the seventh largest correctional system in the U.S. by number of beds, including the federal government and all 50 states.\" [p. 8 10-K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/923796/000119312519050054/d663410d10k.htm) One of the main reasons this has come up in the news lately, is that ~20% of the beds (19k) are used by [ICE](https://imgur.com/ZNzxFXZ). This is one of the key reasons why even banks are starting to [flee](https://www.forbes.com/sites/morgansimon/2019/09/30/geo-group-runs-out-of-banks-as-100-of-banking-partners-say-no-to-the-private-prison-sector/#76a328613298). Additionally [here](https://www.newsweek.com/u-s-spending-private-prisons-geo-group-increase-immigration-detention-1461067).\n\nFrom a revenue perspective, the most basic unit of measure for the industry is Mandays, or the number of days per period that a bed can house an inmate. In other words, 1 bed for 1 quarter represents 90 mandays. Of their 123 owned or leased facilities, GEO has [~4.56mm](https://imgur.com/iqN8VPL) **compensated** mandays. Since 2015, their underlying capacity has increased at ~8% CAGR, which is driving a major portion of their revenue growth along with increases in usage. Stunningly, their revenue was $2.4B for the last twelve months, having grown from $1.8B in FY2015.\n\nLooking a step deeper, their facilities generate $75 - 80/day/inmate for their secured facilities and community facilities. When it is a facility that they do not own, that drops to ~$50/day/inmate. For context, CoreCivic, one of their largest competitors reported that it was [$79.77/day/inmate](https://imgur.com/n3FwmyG) in their June 30 quarterly report, while the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that it was [$99.45](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/04/30/2018-09062/annual-determination-of-average-cost-of-incarceration) for federal inmates. At $80/day, the annual cost for an inmate is $29.2k, which is in line with the estimated taxpayer cost per inmate from [Vera Institute of Justice](https://www.vera.org/downloads/Publications/price-of-prisons-what-incarceration-costs-taxpayers/legacy_downloads/price-of-prisons-updated-version-021914.pdf) on [page 10](https://imgur.com/ITtFfht). \n\nThe net operating income margin depends on the segment (or operating margin specific to the segment, before D&amp;A and G&amp;A overhead expenses). For example the secured facilities have an operating margin of 30 - 33%. So, of the $80/day, GEO earns $24/day. While managed facilities are much closer to a 10 - 13% margin, earning ~$5/day/inmate.\n\nImplicitly in this, then, is that there are two factors that relate to the outlook: [incarceration rate](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png) in the areas that they build their facilities and [average prison sentence](http://apps.urban.org/features/long-prison-terms/demographics.html). \n\nFrom a corporate standpoint, netting out all the corporate overhead expenses, the companies operating margin has held relatively steady around 10 - 13%. In the last twelve months, EBIT was $312mm (on $2.4B of revenue). The company spends approximately $130mm/year on CapEx and $20mm in the last twelve months on working capital (mostly due to receivables). As a result, the company generated $275mm of (free) cash flow over the last year.\n\nThe next question will be, what does it take them to get there, or how much did they have to invest to generate that $275mm. Looking at their June 30 financials, the company has $2.7B of debt and $1B of stockholders' equity. So $275mm on $3.75B of invested capital shows a healthy 8% return on capital. Their debt is a comfortable 4.9% WACD. Assuming a beta of [0.92](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GEO/key-statistics?p=GEO), an ERP of [5.2%](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/), and a 10yr Yield of [1.6%](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/textview.aspx?data=yield) results in a 6.4% cost of equity. Given that they only paid $8mm in cash taxes in 2018 (note: this was already netted out of the free cash flow), I'll assume 20% for the marginal tax rate, resulting in a WACC of 4.6%. So fundamentally, GEO had an economic profit of 7.9% ROC - 4.6% WACC or 3.3% on their $3.75B of capital. As a reminder, as a REIT, GEO is required to distribute &gt;90% of its taxable income to shareholders. So their ability to accrue cash for headwinds may be limited.\n\nOne interesting note looking at their capital structure, the $2.7B debt is currently rated B1 by Moody's, which would fall into the category of highly speculative bonds with their yields in the [9%+ range](https://imgur.com/qZypm9J). Moody's recently did a credit rating review and noted the \"unpredictability of long term federal and state government policy toward incarceration. Moreover, the private corrections sector remains vulnerable to adverse events and public scrutiny\" [source](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-announces-completion-of-a-periodic-review-of-ratings-of--PR_400872). Companies with this sort of credit rating have a 5yr cumulative default rate of 16% ([exhibit 44 here](https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1156859)), which reflects their potential exposure to public perception and state/federal budget issues despite sustained contract renewal rates. In 2020 alone, 7000 beds will be up for [rebid](https://imgur.com/dnSMnS2), which could represent 7,000 x 365 x $80 = $204.4mm of revenue.\n\nTL;DR GEO Group, one of the largest private prison operators in the U.S., is surprisingly large and profitable but faces significant uncertainty around perception issues and government budgeting. As per usual, excel available if requested. Source [charts here](https://imgur.com/a/UN3Wrzr).\n\nAuthor's note: I am leaning to doing GameStop (GME) or Netflix (NFLX) next post for something a bit more relatable and, personally, enjoyable.",

            "title": "[Financial Reports] NFLX Q4 earnings will set the tone for the entire tech industry",
            "text": "NFLX earnings report several key words.\n\nKeyword 1: user downloads\n\nAccording to Sensor Tower, the number of NFLX App downloads in Q4 2021 will be down 6% year-on-year compared to Q4 2020, but after all, the growth and base in Q4 2020 is higher, and the retraction in Q21 is a normal range. At the same time, downloads from January 1-18, 2022 remain flat year-over-year, indicating that the overall change is actually not very significant. Also Sensor Tower illustrates that downloads do not have a linear relationship with NFLX's subscribers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfy0vj1gutc81.png?width=876&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0c31b1c955ca41a8b29952016fcae5d77d8414f2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kd5emsbgutc81.png?width=878&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3ca58a495043003578420eab16908d70bbc267d0\n\nKeyword 2: Number of new subscribers\n\nAgency's forecasts for its Q4 subscription subscriber growth range from 6.25 million to 8.91 million, with a median of 8.13 million, a little lower than the 8.5 million expected in the previous company guidance. It is still mainly a pullback in North America and Europe. Asia Pacific, on the other hand, will continue to grow because of the explosion of \"Squid Games\".\n\nSince this subscription number is the core data of Nifty, the market has gradually started to price-in part of this expectation in the past quarterly changes, and the share price retraced quite a bit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jktehxxhutc81.png?width=870&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=04f6b81028605413fe8f4432ede6c1f4e8110aa8\n\nAmong other things, North America has also increased its subscription prices across the board going into 2022, raising its basic package to $15.49 per month and its package that allows four simultaneous video streams to $19.99 per month. In terms of downloads there is little change at the moment. But the guidance and expectation of subscribers in 22Q1 will be a more sensitive factor for the stock performance next, I am afraid.\n\nMajor investment banks are beginning to diverge in their attitudes, with some believing Netflix has an \"almost insurmountable competitive advantage\" over its competitors in overseas regions, and others believing that Netflix's subscriber growth will slow down.\n\nMeanwhile, the global average paying subscriber is expected to reach 221.6 million.\n\nKeyword 3: Growth rate of revenue and capital expenditure.\n\nThe company's revenue is expected to be $7.664 billion in Q4'21, up 16.3% year-over-year, with the largest revenue growth still in Asia Pacific, while revenue growth in North America is likely to drop to around 10%.\n\nThe company's gross profit and net profit will both decline in Q4 due to increased content amortization, with EPS expected to be $0.81, down 31% year-over-year.\n\nAfter two quarters of silence, NFLX saw a number of content gems in Q4. Q4 hits included the dark comedy drama \"The Handmaiden,\" the second season of \"Emily in Paris,\" and the satirical drama \"Don't Look Up\" with Little Lee and Big Cousin.\n\nIn addition, $Disney(DIS)$ set up a new division to focus on local content for overseas markets, which also allows Nifty to not let up\\~\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oi0nc67mutc81.png?width=871&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=834fbdbed75fdb126c09e00d4d198c00d0726238\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vkniufmsutc81.png?width=879&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=54a79096466bcfa7e8da102d7ba40e143304afb1\n\nIn terms of viewer hours of use, streaming is still expanding. NFLX still maintains the gap with its competitors, but there is a slight decline compared to Q2.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn addition, the big industry began to adjust their price targets for NFLX. Analysts at SmallCap lowered their previous $750 price target to $725.\n\nFrom the valuation point of view, the current valuation level of about 45 times the P/E ratio is not low, and the growth of the cost side and competition in the streaming media industry also put some pressure on future growth. And NFLX, as the predecessor of growth stocks, the valuation level given by the market, will also determine the basis of how much valuation other technology companies can get in the future.",

Dividend stability – I check how long the company has been paying and if the payouts are growing.\n2. Financial health – If the company has too much debt, that’s a red flag.\n3. Dividend payout ratio – If it’s too high (above 80%), the payouts might not be sustainable.\n4. Business prospects – Do I actually like the business?

The main idea is to speed up the process of analyzing an unknown company. It is not meant to replace any human investigation but it can give you a glimpse of the company.\n\nI plan to add competitor analysis, sentimental (mainly from analysts) and EGS data as well, but for now I just want to get your feedback if I should improve the current sections or it's enough for a glimpse.\n\nLet me know what you think, here is my tool: [https://app.mlalpha.com/ai-analyze-company](https://app.mlalpha.com/ai-analyze-company)\n\nThanks a lot.",
